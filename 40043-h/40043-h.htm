<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The publication of this little book was interrupted
by an incident which made me realize
how easy it is for one who spends much time in
trying to study sincerely a political problem to
find himself out of touch with average opinion.
The discovery has made me re-read what I
have written. But re-reading has not led to any
weakening of my expressions, rather the reverse.
I wish only to make a brief general statement
about the point of view from which I
write.</p>

<p>I start from the profound conviction that
what the world needs is peace. There has been
too much war, and too much of many things
that naturally go with war; too much force and
fraud, too much intrigue and lying, too much
impatience, violence, avarice, unreasonableness,
and lack of principle. Before the war I
was a Liberal, and I believe now that nothing
but the sincere practice of Liberal principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
will save European society from imminent revolution
and collapse. But I am conscious of
a certain change of emphasis in my feeling.
Before the war I was eager for large and sweeping
reforms, I was intolerant of Conservatism
and I laughed at risks. The social order had
then such a margin of strength that risks could
safely be taken. Now I feel a need above all
things of the qualities that will preserve civilization.
For that preservation, of course,
Liberality in the full sense is necessary, and
constant progress and a great development of
democracy.</p>

<p>But what is needed most is a return to a
standard of public conduct which was practised,
or at least recognized, by the best Governments
of the world before the war, and
which now seems to have been shaken, if not
shattered. I am not demanding in any wild
idealist spirit that Governments should act according
to the Sermon on the Mount&mdash;though
they well might study it a good deal more than
they do. I am only saying that they must get
back to the standard of veracity, of consistency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
of honesty and economy, and of intellectual
competence, that we had from Peel or Lord
Salisbury or Gladstone.</p>

<p>I do not say that is enough. It is emphatically
not enough. We need in foreign policy
and home policy a higher standard than we had
before, the standard implied by the League of
Nations in international affairs and the ideal
of Co&ouml;peration in domestic affairs. But the
first thing is to recover our wholesome tradition.</p>

<p>I think few serious students of public affairs
will dispute that the long strain of the war, confusing
our ideas of good and evil, and at times
centring our hopes upon things which a normal
civilized man regards with loathing, has resulted
in a widespread degradation of political
conduct. Things are done now, in time of
peace, which would have been inconceivable
before 1914. And they are done now because
we grew accustomed to worse things during the
war. I do not wish to attack any individuals;
but, as an instance of what I mean, one finds
a Ministerial newspaper complacently remarking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
that certain country towns sacked by the
police in Ireland were very small and poor
places in any case, and the sacking not nearly
so complete as the sacking of Belgian towns by
the Germans on less provocation. I find to-day
(November 4, 1920) the Chief Secretary for
Ireland announcing in the House of Commons
that he has had a court of inquiry into the alleged
murder of John Conway by the police,
and presenting an official report that Conway
"died from natural causes"; while at the same
time the <i>Times</i> special correspondent writes:
"I went to the cottage in Rock Street of John
Conway, who was shot on Monday evening,
and saw him lying on his bed with a bullet
wound in the temple." This is one case out of
dozens. It is not a slip or an isolated crime.
I put it to any man who can remember the
years before the war that this represents a
startling degradation of the standard of government.
Such things used to happen in Mexico;
now they happen in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Of course I supported the war. I believe it
was necessary. I make no self-righteous claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
to throw the guilt of it upon others, who did the
fighting by which I and mine were saved. Let
me therefore try to make clear why certain
things shock me profoundly, while I supported
others which can loosely be called "just as
bad."</p>

<p>One of the worst things about war, as Thucydides
has remarked, is that it takes away
your freedom and puts you in a region of necessity.
You may choose whether or not to
fight; but, once fighting, your power of choice
has gone.</p>

<p>Take the treaty with Italy in 1915. Italy
demanded a certain price, if she was to come
into the war on our side. Another party in
Italy was negotiating with the Germans, to see
what inducement could be offered for Italy to
come in on the other side. (I make no complaint
whatever of the conduct of these Italian
statesmen; they naturally consulted the interests
of their country.) The price was high, and
involved the transference to Italy of territory
to which, on principles of self-determination,
she had little claim. But who could refuse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
price? War "is a violent master and teaches
by compulsion."</p>

<p>Take the blockade of Germany. It was a
slow and somewhat cruel weapon to employ,
falling most severely on the most innocent
classes. But Germany was trying to blockade
us, and only our superior strength and skill
at sea caused her plan to fail. It was part of
the normal means of war, and of course we
used it.</p>

<p>Then came an extension of it. Poland, most
unhappy of European nations, was swept by
alternate armies, conquered by the Germans,
devastated and laid bare. The Poles were our
allies. Our newspapers had accounts of the
appalling distress in Poland&mdash;the roads strewn
with skeletons, the almost complete blotting-out
of children under seven, and the like. The
Americans proposed to send food for the relief
of the Poles. But we made objection. We did
not allow food to go into Poland, to save our
own allies, who were starving. Why? Because
the Germans were still taking from the miserable
country all the food they could wring out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
of it. And if the Americans brought in more
food, undoubtedly the enemy would take more.
There was no choice. We had to refuse the
entry of the food ships. But the man who had
to sign that order may well have wished he had
died before the need came to him.</p>

<p>These results and necessities of war, though
I have chosen none of a sensational kind, are
very horrible. It is not easy to think of actions
much more horrible. But they are not exactly
crimes, they are not marks of degradation in
those who order them, because they are done
under the compulsion of war. The alternative
in each case is something equivalent to helping
the enemy.</p>

<p>At the end of the war, after the signing of an
armistice on the basis of the Fourteen Points,
there came at last a moment of free choice. It
came after five years of unspeakable waste&mdash;five
years during which the nations of Europe
had become habituated to cruelty and "all pity
choked with custom of fell deeds." I am anxious
to avoid the faintest semblance of heat or
exaggeration, but I think it can hardly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
disputed that practically every economist agreed
that Europe was on the brink of economic ruin
and could only be saved by a quick revival of
trade; every man of conscience, irrespective of
political party, knew that the first condition
for the recovery of civilization was a change
from the war mind to the peace mind. Such
a change could not happen in a night. It must
needs be gradual. It could only be brought
about by a strong and persistent lead from
those who possessed the ear of the world and
the confidence of their own people. Never in
the whole course of modern history has there
been a more magnificent opportunity than then
lay before the British Prime Minister, never has
there been a clearer call of plain duty. He was
free, as men in public life are seldom free.
Great Britain hung on his lips, and Europe was
waiting for the lead of Great Britain. It was
for him to choose plain good or plain evil. And
he chose, deliberately, evil. He dissolved Parliament
and appealed to the country in a General
Election on a programme of frantic war
passion, coupled with promises which he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
to be false, and which were ridiculed by every
educated man among his surroundings. This
man had before him a task and an opportunity
so glorious that one can scarcely speak of it except
in the language of religion. Many ordinary
men would willingly give their lives if
they could save their fellow creatures from sufferings
and perils far less terrible than those
which then threatened. And he could have
saved them without any sacrifice. It needed
only a little courage. For a week or ten days he
hesitated. Then on December 11 he proclaimed
his programme: the Kaiser's head; the punishment
of enemy war-criminals; Germany to pay
the whole cost of the war; Britain for the British;
rehabilitation of those whom the war had
broken.</p>

<p>At the time when this programme was put
forward I felt bewildered. I did not realize that
any one could be, I will not say so wicked, but
so curiously destitute of generous ambition, so
incapable of thinking greatly. And when I tried
to find out what motive could lie at the back of
a failure so incredible, I was told by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
supporters that the Prime Minister was not thinking
about the matters of which I was thinking.
He was trying to get a very large majority in
the House of Commons and to crush his old
colleagues, and conceivable rivals, entirely out
of existence. Of course he succeeded.</p>

<p>I hope I have put this statement forward
without any malice or party feeling. The state
of the world is far too serious to permit of
either. And I hope that the profound and
burning indignation which I undoubtedly feel
has not biased my judgment. In any case, the
conclusion that I wish to draw is not a personal
but a general one. I doubt if such action
would have been possible before the war in any
constitutional statesman, not to speak of a
clever and humane man like Mr. George. I
doubt if the public opinion of any nation would
have endured it. A nation in which such conduct
is tolerated, and even approved, ought
surely to pause and bethink itself. For it is not
a particular reckless or unfortunate act which
is thus condoned; it is a way of behaviour. It is
a way of behaviour which has its origin in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
methods of war, and of which the characteristic
is that it gives the unscrupulous man the advantage
over the scrupulous man, the cheat
over the honest player, the violent and the
criminal over those who obey the law. It fosters
exactly those things which it is the business
of civilized society to prevent. There are always
lawless and dishonest men in every large
community, as there are criminals in every
army. There are always men who make profit
out of their neighbours' extremity, who use advertisement
to stifle truth, who jeer at all that
is higher than themselves. But in a good social
order they are not influential. They acquire
power only in a society which, in external conduct,
is losing its traditional standards and
inwardly, in the words of Tolstoy's great condemnation,
has forgotten God.</p>

<p>My criticism here is directed against my own
country, and in particular against the British
Prime Minister, not in the least because I have
any anti-British bias. On the contrary, I think
that in most of the international problems of
Europe the influence of Great Britain, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
particular of the British Prime Minister, is generally
an influence for good, though not nearly
such a strong and clear influence as it might be.
I confine these criticisms to our own policy because
the scolding of foreign countries is a notoriously
profitless task. The only criticism
that has any chance of being useful is that of
matters for which the critic or his readers have
some degree of responsibility.</p>

<p>I believe profoundly in the traditions of Liberal
England. As every one knows who has
cared to read my writings, I look to the League
of Nations as the main hope of the world, and
to the British Commonwealth as the mainstay
of the League of Nations. But, if it was ever
doubtful, it is surely clear in the present state
of the world that the Commonwealth cannot
rest upon any secure foundation except the
good-will of its members. And that good-will in
its turn depends upon equal law, good government,
and good faith.</p>

<p>It is not a new lesson that we have to learn:
it is an old lesson that good Englishmen once
knew better than any rulers the world has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
seen, though five years of madness have made it
largely forgotten. But, as Lord Grey has said,
the choice now before us is absolute; we must
learn or perish.</p>

<p>It is in this belief and this spirit that I have
written the following pages, which I hope, except
to those who still live in some unsubstantial
paradise of war-bred delusions, will cause
no permanent offence, nor leave the impression
that where I think others have made mistakes
I imagine that I should make none.</p>

<p>Readers will see that I have aimed throughout
at simplicity of outline. I have deliberately
focused attention on the one central problem,
how to avoid the causes of international strife.
And out of the many and multifarious difficulties
that confront our harassed Foreign Office
to-day, I have concentrated on a few typical
cases. I have omitted, for instance, any discussion
of Turkey, Armenia, Persia, Ireland,
and the relations between Great Britain and
the United States. I have omitted Africa,
where, unless the white man's methods of administration
are reconsidered, one of the gravest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
of the world's future dangers may soon be
in fermentation. And I have said nothing of
the economic problem in Europe, especially in
Austria. The International Financial Commission,
summoned at Brussels by the League
of Nations, has issued a report on this matter
which no government can afford to neglect.
Its first recommendations are disarmament
and freedom of trade, but they will not be
enough without some system of international
credits by which production may be set going
among those populations which at present
have neither food nor raw materials nor the
means of buying them.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Since an edition of this little book is asked
for in America I feel constrained to add a few
words to the Preface. It will be seen that I
have said nothing about two subjects of the
first importance, the Irish Question and the relations
between Great Britain and the United
States. The Irish Question is, under present
conditions, a domestic matter, since Ireland
forms by law part of the United Kingdom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
has the right of full representation in the British
Parliament. It only touches foreign policy
through its effect on foreign opinion.</p>

<p>I do not therefore propose to discuss the
Irish Question here. Personally I believe that
a favourable prospect of settlement is to be
found in the policy advocated by Mr. Asquith
and Lord Grey, and loosely called "Dominion
Home Rule." This would put Ireland roughly
in the same position as the self-governing British
colonies, and would at once have two very
important effects. It would put an end to the
present oppressions and would give Ireland the
right to a seat at the Assembly of the League
of Nations. But I fear that no settlement
whatever is possible in Ireland until the present
Government is replaced by some other with
more sincerity in its purpose and less blood
upon its hands. The accounts of British misdeeds
which I read in the Sinn Fein Bulletin
and in some American newspapers appear to
me to be both exaggerated and one-sided. Men
exasperated by persecution are not as a rule
capable of giving a perfectly fair and benevolent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
account of the behaviour of their persecutors.
But in spite of the Government's policy
of rigorous concealment, the Irish can now appeal
to the evidence of a witness as nearly unimpeachable
as can be expected in human affairs,
a County Court Judge appointed originally
by the British Government itself. Judge
Bodkin, in a report submitted to the British
Government on cases of crime which came before
his Court in Clare County at the Hilary
Sessions of 1920, states: "There were in all 139
cases in which it was proved that the criminal
injuries were committed by armed forces of the
Government, and only in the five cases already
mentioned were any witnesses examined to
justify, deny, or explain. In no case was there
any evidence to suggest that the victims had
been guilty of any offence."</p>

<p>In answer to a report like this the Government
allows no public inquiry, inflicts, so far as
is known, no punishment on the criminals,
awards no compensation to the victims, and
yet does not take any legal steps against its accuser.
Such conduct does not seem compatible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
with innocence. Indeed the complicity of the
Government, particularly of Mr. Lloyd George
and Sir Hamar Greenwood, in the system of
illegal outrages called "reprisals" is no longer
disputed, and has especially been brought out
in Parliament by a conservative member, Mr.
Oswald Moseley. The exact degree of complicity
is, of course, open to doubt. If I may give
my own opinion for what it is worth, I suspect
that at some time when the Irish police forces
were disposed to resign or to strike owing to
the constant danger of assassination in which
the Government's policy required them to live,
the Government gave their officers some assurance
that, if they would only stay on, their own
conduct in dealing with Sinn Feiners would not
be too closely scrutinized. That was the usual
method pursued by the Czar's Government
when arranging pogroms.</p>

<p>The defence of the British Ministers is that
they were faced from the outset by a very difficult
situation, owing to the irreconcilable differences
between the northeast corner of Ulster
and the rest of Ireland. Anxious for Tory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
support they gave pledges, the exact tenor of which
has not been divulged, to Sir Edward Carson,
the Ulster leader, and thus tied their own
hands. The condition of Ireland became increasingly
embittered, till, shortly after Sir
Hamar Greenwood's appointment, the extreme
Sinn Fein party, refusing parliamentary action
and unable to meet the English in battle,
adopted a policy of assassination. The Government,
much embarrassed, did just what most
bad governments generally have done in other
parts of the world. They tried to stamp out the
Sinn Fein terror by organizing a terror of their
own, meeting crime by still more formidable
crime, and recklessly confusing the innocent
with the guilty. At last they have succeeded in
uniting all Catholic Ireland in such detestation
of the British name that an Irishman will now
never betray another Irishman, however guilty,
to the British police, nor even feel that the killing
of an Englishman is quite the same thing as
murder. "Things being in this state," the Government
pleads, "how can we be expected to
govern Ireland according to civilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
standards?" The answer is that they cannot, and
had better make room for another Government
which can.</p>

<p>I cannot tell how great an effect this Irish
calamity has had in embittering the relations
between America and Great Britain. I would
only venture to lay before Americans of moderate
views my conviction that the great mass of
educated opinion in England joins with the
Free Liberals and the Labour Party in utterly
condemning the Government's Irish administration.
This conclusion is derived from
personal conversation with people of various
parties, and from the overwhelming anti-Government
votes in the bye-elections, and
the increasing protests and rebellions among
the Government's supporters in Parliament. I
have to admit that this condemnation is not reflected
in the House of Commons as a whole, an
utterly abnormal House elected in a moment
when not only the fever of war, but many other
fevers and corruptions of the body politic were
at their height. It is not even reflected adequately
in the press. For the press in England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
with a few most honourable exceptions, is in the
hands of a small number of individuals who&mdash;to
say the least of it&mdash;were not elected to their
present position of power by the confidence of
their countrymen nor appointed thereto on
grounds of intellect or character or public
spirit. England is admittedly not in a very
healthy state of mind. But, even now, at her
worst, she is a far better and more decent country
than could be concluded from either the
London press or the House of Commons.</p>

<p>The picture I have given of European affairs
may, I can well see, be taken in either of two
ways by an American. It may well confirm his
determination to keep absolutely clear of a
world at once so ill-directed and so miserable.
The case for American isolation is very easy to
state and to understand. What is there to attract
America towards further co&ouml;peration with
any of the larger European nations? France? I
can imagine no sane statesmen wishing to be
drawn into the orbit of France in her present
mood or with her present prospects. Germany?
The existing German Government seems good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
but old enmities do not so quickly die down,
and Germany has still to prove that she is an
honest and a peaceful power. Russia? To ask
the question is to answer it. England? Who
would wish to co&ouml;perate with the British Government
in holding down Ireland by "competition
in crime," in re&euml;stablishing her slippery
grasp on Mesopotamia, laboriously pacifying
India and Egypt, and struggling indefinitely
against Russian conspiracies to destroy her influence
in the Moslem world? How can an
American wish to remit England's debt to
America when she is at this moment invading
Germany in order to collect "to the last farthing"
a claim which the American delegates at
the Peace Conference rejected as extortionate?
And who would wish to increase the wealth of a
Government which, immediately after the War
to end War, is lavishing all it can afford, and
more, on armaments and military expeditions?
Other less plausible arguments could easily be
added. The suggestion, for instance, that this
country, or any party or any fraction of a party
in this country, intends or ever intended to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
the Japanese Alliance for a war against the
United States is the merest moonshine, and has
been repeatedly disproved by the terms of the
old treaty and by the public statements of both
parties. But, taking only arguments that have
some basis of truth, the case for American isolation
is very strong.</p>

<p>And yet it is the wrong case. It is based, I
venture to think, first on a misunderstanding,
and next on too narrow a point of view. A misunderstanding;
because it is not co&ouml;peration in
that sense which is asked of her. She is not
asked to support the policies of any European
nation. The League of Nations is not an alliance.
She is asked only to sit in council with the
other nations&mdash;as free and unpledged as they,
or, if she wishes, still more so&mdash;to help those
who have suffered, and are in part still sick in
body and brain with their suffering, to face the
vast problems which now confront mankind,
and which the rest of us have pledged ourselves
to face in the spirit of peace and justice and
common sense which we thought was characteristically
American. It is based on too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
narrow a view, because all summary judgments of
foreign nations are that, whether they end in
praise or blame. "La noble, l'incomparable
Angleterre" of M. Briand is just as remote from
fact as the "brutal and bloody Britain" of Mr.
Hearst. Nations are made up of masses of individuals,
who differ among themselves within
each nation just about as much as the citizens
of one nation differ from those of another. In
every nation there are numbers of criminals
and numbers of fine men. In every nation's
past there are black places and white. Only it
so happens that just now, after a time of hideous
suffering and wrong-doing, in the midst of a
time of savage resentments and passions and
great material difficulties, the nations of the
world are from the depth of their hearts longing
for some way of avoiding war and treating
one another in future a little more openly and
fairly than they have in the past. They know
they must have disputes, and that when the
disputes come it is one of two things; they must
either talk them out or fight them out. They
are meeting to talk them out. But how can the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
talk be quite frank and free, or how can the
promises of peace and fair dealing carry full
conviction, while the greatest and the least
wounded of all the nations refuses to join in
them, but sits aloof in silence, from time to
time sharpening her sword?</p>

<p>A friend of mine was recently travelling in
Germany in a third-class railway carriage. The
engine was slow and in lack of oil. The carriages,
once so clean, warm, and well lighted,
were unlit, dirty, and bitterly cold. There was
an air of broken nerves and misery among the
passengers, and one woman was still sobbing
from some indignity offered to her by a foreign
official in the occupied area. Presently an old
gentleman, apparently a lawyer of some eminence,
broke out: "A reckoning must come. My
little grandchildren are drinking in revenge
with their mother's milk. In thirty years
or thereabouts we shall settle accounts with
France, and then we shall make"&mdash;he swept
the air with his hand&mdash;"<i>tabula rasa!</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>"Herr Justizrat," answered a younger man,
"did you take part in the war? I think not&mdash;you
would be over the age. I was in the war
for four years.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I agree with you that, in all
probability, in thirty or forty years we shall
settle our account with France and make <i>tabula
rasa</i>. And in thirty or forty years after
that France will have her reckoning with us
and make <i>tabula rasa</i> of Germany; and then we
again, and so on. But, if you will excuse me,
Herr Justizrat, I do not find in the prospect any
of the satisfaction which it appears to give
you."</p>

<p>An incident of this sort may be significant or
may not. It may be typical or may be exceptional.
But my friend's experience seems exactly
to agree with the report made by Herr
Simons to the Reichstag in the last week of
August, 1920, upon the attitude of the German
Government towards the war then proceeding
between Poland and Russia. The Entente
Powers had invited Germany to take certain
unneutral steps on the side of Poland; the Government
had, as a matter of course, refused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
The Soviet Government had also invited Germany
to join in the war on their side, holding
out the hope that such action by Germany
would precipitate a Bolshevik revolution in
Poland and other parts of eastern Europe and
lead to an alliance capable of defying the Entente.
The German Government, said Herr
Simons, carefully considered these proposals,
as it felt bound to consider any possible prospect
of escape for Germany from the intolerable
servitude imposed upon her by the
Peace of Versailles, but decided that it was
not in the public interest to accept them.</p>

<p>Thus the German Foreign Minister, a man
respected by all parties, expresses in sober and
thoughtful language much the same sentiment
as the Justizrat in his passion. The Peace of
Versailles has, like most settlements imposed
by conquerors upon their beaten enemies, produced
a condition so intolerable that the vanquished
must be expected to seize the first favourable
opportunity for fighting to free themselves.
It has sown the seeds of future war.</p>

<p>Now, it was the great hope of English Liberals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and those who agreed with them, that, contrary
to almost all precedent, this war might be
ended by a peace so high-minded and statesmanlike
and far-seeing, so scrupulously fair to
the vanquished and so single-mindedly set upon
the healing of national wounds and the reconstruction
of a shattered society, that the ordinary
motives for a war of revenge would not exist,
and the nations might really co&ouml;perate with
one another to save all Europe from a common
ruin. In 1914 and 1915, when war still seemed
to Englishmen an almost incredible horror, and
it was still necessary to appeal to men's consciences
if we wished them to fight, volunteers
were invited for a "war to end war." The
statesmen who, in those days, were still the
leaders of the country, were emphatic in stating
that we were not engaged in any attempt to
destroy or oppress the German people, but only
"the military domination of Prussia." Even
later, when the Liberal and idealist elements
in the country withered in the poisonous air
or were supplanted by more robust forces, it
seemed as if President Wilson was upholding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
with even greater insistence and emphasis, the
banner of ultimate reconciliation as the goal
of the war. For the war itself he prescribed
"Force, Force to the utmost, Force without
stint or limit, righteous and triumphant Force,
which shall make Right the Law of the World
and cast every selfish dominion down in the
dust" (April 6, 1918); but, as soon as the Hohenzollerns
were overthrown, he was for what he
called "peace without victory," a peace with
no element of revenge, "a new international
order based upon broad and universal principles
of right and justice" (February 11, 1918).
Especial emphasis was laid on our good-will
towards the German people. "We have no
quarrel with the German people. We have no
feeling towards them but one of sympathy and
friendship" (April 2, 1917). "They did not
originate or desire this hideous war .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we are
fighting their cause, as they will some day see it,
as well as our own" (Flag Day, 1917).</p>

<p>It is not clear that this ideal was an impossible
one. The war of Prussia against Austria
in 1866 was unscrupulous and aggressive in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
origin; but Bismarck meant it to end in a reconciliation
after victory, and so it did. He
secured a peace which left no sting of injustice
behind it, Lincoln did not live to make the
settlement with the South after the American
Civil War; but enough is known of his intentions
to make us sure that he intended to carry
through at all costs a peace of reconciliation,
extremely different from that which took place
when he was gone. The British war against the
Boers in 1899-1902, though open to the severest
criticism in its origin, ended in a genuine
peace of reconciliation in the settlement of 1906,
for which the reward came rapidly and in full
measure at the outbreak of the Great War. Had
things been a little different in 1918, had President
Wilson had the same support from his
own people that he had from the best elements
in Europe, had a Liberal or Labour Government
been in power to make a settlement of the
Great War like the settlement which followed
the Boer War, had the popular influences of the
time been better guided, Europe might have
had a genuinely Liberal peace. Indeed, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
seemed at the last moment almost certain that
a Liberal peace had been secured. In an address
to Congress on January 8, 1918, President
Wilson laid down his memorable Fourteen
Points to be observed in any treaty of peace
with Germany. The first five may be especially
noted:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Open covenants of peace openly arrived at,
after which there shall be no private international
understandings of any kind, but diplomacy shall
always proceed frankly and in the public view.</p>

<p>2. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas
outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war,
except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part
by international action for the enforcement of international
covenants.</p>

<p>3. The removal as far as possible of all economic
barriers, and the establishment of an equality of
trade conditions among all nations consenting to
the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.</p>

<p>4. Adequate guarantees given and taken that
national armaments will be reduced to the lowest
point consistent with domestic safety.</p>

<p>5. A free, open-minded and absolutely impartial
adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict
observance of the principle that in determining all
such questions of sovereignty the interests of the
populations concerned must have equal weight<span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
with the equitable claims of the Government whose
title is to be determined.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>The Fourteen Points were not only acclaimed
by Liberal opinion in England: they were vigorously
circulated by our Government propaganda
in Germany and Austria, as were all
other statements considered likely to induce
the enemy peoples to weaken or surrender. On
October 5, 1918, the German Republican Government
proposed peace on the basis of the
Fourteen Points. "They requested President
Wilson to take into his hands the task of establishing
peace on the basis of the Fourteen
Points contained in his message to Congress of
January 8, 1918, and on the basis of his subsequent
proclamations, especially his speech of
September 27, 1918." Later on they asked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
President to inquire if the Allied Governments
also agreed to them. In response to his inquiries
the Allied Governments sent in to him
an identical memorandum:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Allied Governments have given careful consideration
to the correspondence which has passed
between the President of the United States and the
German Government. Subject to the qualifications
which follow, they declare their willingness to make
peace with the Government of Germany on the
terms of peace laid down in the President's address
to Congress of January 8, 1918, and the principles
of settlement enunciated in his subsequent addresses.
They must point out, however, that what
is usually described as the Freedom of the Seas is
open to various interpretations, some of which they
could not accept. They must therefore reserve to
themselves complete freedom on this subject when
they enter the Peace Conference.</p></div>

<p>One further "qualification" was made by the
Allied Powers: by the "restoration" of the
invaded territories they understood "that compensation
would be made by Germany for all
damage done to the civilian population of the
Allies and their property by the aggression of
Germany by land, by sea and from the air."</p>

<p>Thus the Fourteen Points were converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
into a solemn international agreement. The
Allies agreed that the treaty of peace should
consist of the application in detail of that fundamental
document. On that understanding the
Germans laid down their arms and surrendered
their means of defence.</p>

<p>It is always difficult in the affairs of a democratic
country to determine the exact point
where mere inconsistency and laxity of thought,
or even mere lack of co&ouml;rdination between the
various organs of government, merge into
something like deliberate perfidy. It may so
easily happen that one set of individuals give
the promise and quite another set act in breach
of it. But an Englishman who wishes seriously
to understand the present international situation
must begin by realizing clearly that the
treaty imposed on the Germans at Versailles,
after they had surrendered their arms, appears
to them and to a large number of neutral observers
as a monstrous breach of faith. It contravened
in spirit and in detail much of what
they understood by the Fourteen Points. I
confess that, after reading carefully the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Protest and the Allied Reply, it seems to me
that the German reading of President Wilson's
terms was in some points the natural one; and,
apart from the treaty itself, that the action
taken against the Germans when they were
disarmed was not consistent with the language
and the pledges addressed to them while they
were still in the field. As a matter of fact, certain
of those responsible, or partly responsible,
for the negotiations on the Entente side, when
they saw the way things were going, recalled
bitterly the great historic perfidy by which
Rome trapped Carthage to her doom.</p>

<p>A charge of this kind is, of course, very serious;
and the results of the action taken at Versailles
have been more than serious. I will ask
my readers patiently to consider in broad outlines
the causes, psychological and other, which
seem to have been at work; for of course it is
quite possible and even probable that, of the
main actors concerned, not one had any intention
of trying to trap the Germans by perjury.
Some of them doubtless were unscrupulous
men, such as wars habitually throw to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
surface; but they were not men of the Machiavellian
type.</p>

<p>Two broad facts stand out clearly to one
who studies the documents. First, the Governments
which accepted President Wilson's
Fourteen Points as the basis of peace with Germany
were from the start quite out of sympathy
with his spirit. Why, then, did they accept
them? Because they had really no choice.
To refuse would not have been only to reject a
long delayed and desperately needed peace. It
would have been to confess to the world that,
contrary to so many previous professions,
their aims were frankly what is now termed
"imperialistic." Above all, it would have been
to alienate Mr. Wilson, without whom victory
was impossible. They were bound to accept.</p>

<p>But Mr. Wilson's language was often rather
lacking in definiteness. Who knows exactly
what "justice" is, or what may be regarded as
consideration for "the true interests" of the
German people? They accepted the terms; but
they were free to use all permissible ingenuity
in interpreting a document which they had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
drawn up, and which had been forced upon
them in a time of need.</p>

<p>Furthermore, one who labours through the
four hundred and forty articles of the treaty,
with their innumerable subdivisions, will find
not merely that the treaty represents broadly
the victory of the right side over the wrong,
and is a charter of emancipation to large parts
of Europe. He will find also that four hundred
or more of the detailed articles are reasonable
enough and many of them excellent. The injustice
arises in two ways. First, that on every
doubtful point, and there are many, the decision
is apt to be given against the enemy; and
next, that behind the respectable structure of
the treaty there existed in fact a flood of white-hot
war-passion&mdash;revenge, hate, terror, suspicion,
and raging covetousness&mdash;which poisoned
the atmosphere and here and there made
a breach in the protecting wall.</p>

<p>A great English military critic somewhat
shocked public opinion by saying at the time
of the armistice, "This armistice is wrong. We
have got them down, and now we ought to kick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
them till we have had enough." The French,
he said, ought to have continued the war and
marched on to Berlin, plundering and ravaging
till they had satisfied their revenge. The words
sound like insanity, but the speaker explained
them later on. A war of revenge, he argued, is
within the limits of pardonable human nature.
And it comes to an end. But, being cheated of
their decisive campaign of victory, the French
were making a peace of revenge; and that is a
thing which is apt to admit of no forgiveness
and no finish.</p>

<p>I quote these words not because I agree with
them in practical policy, but because of the profound
psychological truth that they express.
Behind the statesmen who had pledged their
words, however unwillingly, remained masses
of ignorant, violent, and war-maddened people,
many of them with terrible wrongs to avenge
and no guide or leader to help them against
themselves. We need not recall, though few
sensitive people will ever forget, the horrors of
the propaganda of hate. It is only worth realizing
that the mob-inspired journalists and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
journalist-inspired mobs who clamoured for an
utter and all-devouring peace of revenge, including
the starvation and enslavement of
half Europe for thirty or fifty or a hundred
years, had never themselves signed the Fourteen
Points and felt no personal inconsistency
or turpitude if they compelled the Supreme
Council of the Allies to break its faith.</p>

<p>The first step in this policy lay outside the
treaty. The third of the Fourteen Points established
"equality of trade conditions" and
the "removal of economic barriers" between all
the nations consenting to the peace. Immediately
after the armistice a proposal was made,
and met with strong American support, that
the Allies should set themselves at once to attempting
to cope with the threatened famine
and the lack of raw materials in Central Europe,
and thus get European trade on its legs
again as early as possible. This would relieve
a vast amount of distress, serve as a stepping-stone
to reconciliation, save many nations from
the danger of irremediable collapse, and also
make far more possible the restoration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
invaded areas and the payment of large reparations
by Germany. It was proposed to follow
the analogy of the peace of 1871; to draw up a
preliminary peace agreement, stating principles
and limits but not details. For example, it
might be agreed that Germany must surrender
some territory in the West and in Poland, but
not beyond certain geographical lines; must
pay an indemnity to be fixed on certain principles,
but not to exceed a certain sum, and the
like. The territorial agreement, again, might
be based on the elaborate statement of war aims
issued by the British Government on January
10, 1917. The Germans could have accepted
this, and the work of reconstruction been begun
immediately. Incalculable distress and
suffering would thus have been saved.</p>

<p>But another view prevailed. With the short-sightedness
that so often accompanies brutality,
the German High Command had, in the
very last months of the war, when their defeat
was certain, tried systematically to cripple the
industry of Belgium and France by destroying
mines, breaking machinery, carrying off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
movable plant, and the like. Their own manufacturing
plant was undamaged, and they indulged
in the fatuous expectation that they might recapture
their lost markets and spring into prosperity,
while France and Belgium were still too
crippled to commence work. Of course, this
could not be allowed. The obvious alternatives,
such as allocating certain German factories to
French or Belgian companies whose plant had
been destroyed, or simply allocating the profits
to purposes of reparation, appear not to have
been considered. The blinder motives were too
strong, and no statesman arose to give guidance.
All Germany must be punished. She had not
been invaded and ravaged. She must be made
to suffer the pains of invasion. She must be
ravaged in cold blood. The complete ruin of
Germany, argued certain French journalists
and politicians, was demanded by all considerations
both of justice and of safety, and it had
not by any means been attained. Russia was
paralyzed and wrecked by Bolshevism. But
the German Revolution had been carried successfully
through. The people were not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
demoralized, and the problem was how to demoralize
them. Perhaps starvation would do it.
Hence was started the policy of deliberately
ruining Germany, after her surrender, by a long
blockade in time of what, to the ordinary man,
appeared to be peace, and immediately after a
promise of "the removal of economic barriers
and the establishment of equality of trade conditions."
This was not a technical breach of
faith; technically we were still at war with Germany,
and we had never promised not to starve
our enemies after their surrender. The promise
of equality of trade conditions only applied to
conditions after the peace. Nevertheless, a historian
will probably regard the establishment
and continuance of this blockade of the enemy
lands after their surrender as one of those many
acts of almost incredible inhumanity which have
made the recent Great War conspicuous in the
annals of mankind and shaken thoughtful men's
faith in the reality of modern civilization. Certain
articles in the <i>Matin</i> discussing the exact
dose of famine desirable in order to create the
maximum of individual suffering and public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
weakness in the Boche are difficult to parallel
in the literature of morbid hate, except among
some of the German war pamphlets.</p>

<p>Thus the Fourteen Points, besides a regrettable
indefiniteness of phrasing, had the fatal
fault of being utterly out of touch with the feeling
of most of the belligerents. As the time
wore on this feeling asserted its influence on
the terms of the treaty. The Boche had deliberately
and treacherously plunged Europe into
war; he had waged the war with revolting cruelty;
he had inflicted unheard-of suffering on
the innocent, and, by a miracle, he had been
beaten. Now let him pay the penalty! President
Wilson had pledged the Allies "to be just
to the German people as to all others.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To
propose anything but justice to Germany at
any time would be to renounce our own cause."
"Very good," answered the dominant voices of
1918; "the criminal asks for justice, and so far
as our power reaches, justice he shall have!"
The total of wrongs done by Germany, in plotting
the war, in waging it, and in the destruction
of life and property, could easily be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
regarded as an almost infinite sum, and "Justice"
surely demanded for that an almost infinite
punishment.</p>

<p>The first concession to this insistent pressure
was on a point of form. The language of the
Fourteen Points and the accompanying documents
implied that the treaty would be a matter
of discussion and negotiation. The basis
was agreed upon; it seemed natural to suppose
that the next step was to negotiate. But popular
feeling had caught at the phrase "unconditional
surrender"; and, though nothing could
be clearer than the fact that the German army
had surrendered on perfectly explicit conditions,
signed and agreed to by every Government
concerned, it was decided that terms
were not to be negotiated but "imposed." Mr.
Keynes has shown in an interesting way how
great was the effect of this decision. Terms
were drawn up with a view to bargaining, leaving
a margin for possible concessions; and then
there was no bargaining. The whole demand
was suddenly enforced.</p>

<p>Questions of territory outside Europe were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
decided purely by conquest. Immense areas in
Asia and Africa were seized as spoil by the
strongest Powers, though the conditions of
their tenure were, so it was hoped, to be regulated
by the League of Nations. In some cases
there was a pretence of consulting the wishes of
the inhabitants; in most cases this was not
practicable. In Syria and South Tyrol the
wishes of the inhabitants were notoriously
overridden. In Europe as a whole, however,
the decisions were made on Wilsonian principles.
True, they told heavily against Germany.
But as a matter of fact the Germans and
German Austrians, by reason of their great
strength and high organizing power, had an
imperial position in Europe, and any liberation
of subject or quasi-subject nationalities was
bound to be at the expense of the Germans.
The territorial settlement, in spite of the great
and needless distress produced by the break-up
of the Austro-Hungarian system, is on principles
of nationality juster than that which preceded
it. The more extreme anti-German
claims were successfully resisted. France was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
not allowed to annex Germany up to the Elbe,
as M. Hanotaux wished; nor even up to the
Rhine. No partition of Germany by force was
permitted, though an agitation for that purpose
still continues in France and the prohibition of
any future union between German-Austria and
the rest of Germany was actually embodied in
the treaty. The treaty of Berlin had in just the
same way attempted to forbid the unity of Bulgaria.</p>

<p>As regards the penal clauses, it may be convincingly
argued that the great crimes and
cruelties and breaches of law which have signalized
this war ought emphatically to meet
with judgment and punishment from some
tribunal representing the conscience of civilized
mankind. On grounds of justice the presence
of such penal clauses in the treaty could be amply
justified, though considerations of policy
make it more questionable. But all thoughts
of equal justice disappeared in derision when it
was found that only crimes committed by the
enemies of the Entente were to be punished;
crimes committed by British, French, Italian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Serbian or American criminals were privileged
acts, to which "Justice" had nothing to say.</p>

<p>This absurd clause has, of course, given rise
to suspicions, more absurd than itself, of dark
crimes committed by Entente generals which
must be concealed at any cost. Such suggestions
are nonsense. Indefensible as it is, the
clause was dictated by no more sinister passion
than ordinary national vanity. The economic
clauses were open to graver suspicions. It was
whispered that trade interests of not quite
unimpeachable character had some influence
with members of the French, the Italian, and
even the English Government; and the old
German accusation that England entered the
war in order to destroy a trade rival, utterly
untrue at the time, seemed to receive some colour
by the terms of peace. Germany depended
for her prosperity on her industry and her overseas
trade. Her industry was wrecked by an
immense demand upon her coal. The mines of
Lorraine, the Saar Valley, and, subject to plebiscite,
of Silesia, were handed over to other
states; and out of the remainder Germany was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
condemned to pay an amount of coal which
proved, on investigation at Spa, two years
later, to be beyond her powers. Her overseas
trade was annihilated at a blow by the seizure
of all the vessels of her mercantile marine exceeding
1600 tons gross and a large proportion
of her small vessels and fishing-boats, combined
with a demand upon such ships as she
might build in future. Her voice was stifled by
the seizure of all her telegraphic cables: news
henceforth was to be a monopoly of the conquerors.
At the same time all her colonies
were taken from her. She was forbidden to set
up any tariffs for her own protection. Her
navigable rivers were put under the control of
international commissions on which the Germans
or Austrians were a small minority. And
while it was somewhat unctuously explained to
Germany that in a virtuous world trade would
be free and untrammelled, and that the commissions
only intended to see that she did not
erect barriers against her innocent neighbours,
there was no provision whatever made to debar
the Allies from erecting what barriers they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
pleased against Germany. "It would appear
to be a fundamental fallacy," declared the Allied
Reply, "that the political control of a
country is essential in order to procure a reasonable
share of its products. Such a proposal
finds no foundation in economic law or history."
It has found some foundation in history
since.</p>

<p>The triumph of penal ingenuity, however,
was the indefinite indemnity. It was agreed on
both sides that Germany was to pay an indemnity.
She did not demur. Indeed, her mouth
was closed by the monstrously oppressive and
inhuman proposals various Germans had themselves
put forward when they expected to win
the war. She had openly intended to "bleed
France and England white." Now that she
was beaten she was prepared to pay. She accepted
the duty of "restoring" the invaded
territories. This was defined as "reparation
for all damage done to the civil population of
the Allies by German aggression." The Germans
probably understood this to mean the
damage done to civilian life and property by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
invasions or raids; but they were told that
this view was too narrow. Every soldier killed
or wounded had civilians dependent on him;
nay, he himself was really a civilian forced by
German aggression to desert his business. All
his business losses, the separation allowances
to his wife, the pensions to ex-soldiers or to
their dependents, all damage to any one's
"health or honour," were ultimately "due to
German aggression" and should be paid by
Germany. No such terms had ever been heard
of before, true; but the British electors had
been promised that "Germany should pay the
whole cost of the war"; and the sense of the
solemn contract was distorted to suit the election
cry. After 1871 the Germans had imposed
on France what was then considered the extremely
severe indemnity of two hundred million
pounds sterling. Some experts now proposed
two thousand million sterling as an adequate
indemnity to be paid by Germany, others
three thousand million. That was emended by
popular orators to ten thousand million; thirty
thousand million; fifty thousand million.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Absurd to say that Germany could not pay! If all
German property were confiscated and all Germans
for seventy-five years were made to work
for the Allies at a bare subsistence wage, a well-known
English public man was prepared to get
more than fifty thousand million out of them.</p>

<p>The Americans bluntly refused to endorse
demands which they considered extortionate.
The indemnity was left unspecified. It should
depend on Germany's capacity to pay. Let the
Germans get to work at once and do their best.
The more they produced, the more the Allies
would take; and if, after two years or so, it became
necessary to fix the sum, the less the Germans
had produced in those two years the less
they would eventually have to pay. It is said
that some of the British Ministers, secretly
anxious to be more reasonable than was consistent
with popularity at the moment, wished
to postpone the fixing of the indemnity until
the rage of their own "Khaki Election" should
have cooled down. But their calculation was a
bad one. As the German delegation observed:
"The German people would feel themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
condemned in slavery, because everything
they accomplished would benefit neither themselves
nor even their children, but merely
strangers. But the system of slave labour has
never been successful."</p>

<p>For the purpose of raising money the proposal
was merely fatuous. It took away from the
Germans every possible motive for producing
wealth. But its object in some minds was not
money: its object was the permanent ruin of
Germany. It was feared in France that, though
the Germans were now exhausted and beggared,
their notorious industry and ingenuity might
in time enable them to pay off their indemnity
and rise again to affluence and strength. So
it was arranged that, for some years at least,
they should be deprived of every motive for
industry.</p>

<p>Lastly, a new provision was made about
private property. The rule hitherto observed
in the land wars of civilized states was that
enemy private property was respected, and if
seized during the war was restored at the conclusion
of peace. This rule was, of course, enforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in favour of any property belonging to nationals
of the Entente countries situated in enemy
lands; but reciprocity was not admitted. The
private property of any German situate in any
part of the world which was under the control
of the Ententes was <i>ipso facto</i> confiscated. "The
Allied and Associated Powers reserve the right
to retain and liquidate all" such property.
Every German, however innocent, who had
settled in our territory before the war was thus
exposed to be robbed of everything he possessed.
Nay, it seems almost incredible, but in the original
form of the treaty which was put before the
enemy for signature the stipulation seems actually
to have been laid down that any property
which a German might hereafter make or
acquire in Entente territory should be liable to
confiscation at the will of the Entente Governments!
This clause was too much even for the
atmosphere of Versailles, and in response to
the German protest the stipulation about the
future was dropped.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
confiscation, the Entente Reply brazens it out with
the remark that the property is not really taken
from the individual, as his own Government
can always pay him back! And in case the private
property of Germans in neutral countries
should have an unfair advantage, the Reparation
Commission obtained special powers for
confiscating that too, up to the limit of &pound;100,000,000.</p>

<p>We need not stop to consider whether there
was any extraordinary exhibition of "Teutonic
insolence" in the action of certain German officials
who resigned their offices rather than sign
this treaty; nor need we swell the chorus of English,
French, Italian, and American newspapers
in expressing the natural horror of those refined
nations at the bad manners of Count
Brockdorf-Rantzau in actually breaking a
paper-knife in the stress of his emotion, when,
under protest, he consented to sign. There was
one man among the British representatives who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
had known what it was to be conquered after
a desperate war. General Smuts was a man of
imagination as well as a soldier and a statesman.
He hesitated long before signing the
treaty; and when, in the end, he decided that
it was necessary to do so, he immediately published
a statement of protest. "I have signed
the peace treaty, not because I consider it a
satisfactory document, but because it is imperatively
necessary to close the war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
six months since the armistice was signed have
perhaps been as upsetting, unsettling, and
ruinous to Europe as the previous four years of
war. I look upon the peace treaty as the close
of those two chapters of war and armistice, and
only on that ground do I sign it." Liberal
opinion in England muttered assent. Some important
officials resigned. But the fear of upsetting
peace altogether prevented any open
protest in Parliament. We need not lose ourselves
in speculations as to the strange devices
to which public men can sink when their self-interest
is clear and their responsibility can be
denied or evaded; nor yet as to the infinite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
ramifications by which war spreads its poison
through human society, a thing twice-cursed,
cursing him that strikes and him that suffers.
The old German Government had committed
a vast crime against humanity; its people had
backed it up, as all European peoples back up
their own Governments, and could not expect
to escape heavy punishment. The one question
we need ask ourselves is this: Is it not as certain,
as anything in human nature can be, that
a treaty of such a character, imposed on a conquered
nation by force, if not also by treachery,
will, as a matter of course and without the
faintest scruple, be broken as soon as there is
a favourable opportunity for breaking it? Of
course the Germans will break it if they can;
and of course they will make another war, call
it a war of revenge or a war for freedom as you
please, as soon as there is any chance of winning
it.</p>

<p>So said the Justizrat in the train. So, in effect,
says Herr Simons; so almost <i>ad nauseam</i>
repeat all the German Conservative and patriotic
newspapers. It is difficult to see how any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
German who is not a convinced pacifist should
do otherwise than prepare with all his energies
for the next war, unless some other way is made
possible of escape from a tormenting servitude.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Position_France" id="Position_France"></a><span class="smcap">II. The Position of France</span></h4>

<p>If that is so, what is the position of France?
France in 1914 was forced into a war which she
tried hard to avoid. The French suffered horribly
and fought heroically. They sacrificed
everything to the war. And we, who know
what our own people paid in broken nerve, in
bitterness, and in economic dislocation, cannot
be surprised that France has paid a heavie
price. They escaped defeat by the help of England,
Russia, Italy, and America; without these
powerful allies they would certainly have been
defeated. We need not try to estimate exactly
what their fate would have been if they had
lost the late war, because if they lose the next
their treatment will be infinitely worse. It will
be, as far as possible, <i>tabula rasa</i>. It will be the
passing of the horse-hoofs of Attila. Meantime
France's allies are, naturally enough, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
home and attending to their own businesses;
her population is much smaller than Germany's
and increases even more slowly.</p>

<p>A French statesman of the type of M. Poincar&eacute;
or M. Hanotaux makes himself no illusions.
Germany is the enemy. Germany will fight
again as soon as she is strong enough. Therefore
she must never be allowed to become strong
enough. M. Hanotaux, who was Foreign Minister
during the years 1894-98, when French
foreign policy was more ably managed than
now, has recently published a book in criticism
of the Treaty of Versailles. He does not deal
in any Wilsonian phrases about justice or humanity;
he considers the treaty solely with a
view to the security of France, and he finds it
sadly wanting. And a large mass of opinion,
probably the prevailing opinion, in France supports
him.</p>

<p>First of all, it must be remembered, France
wanted, and thought she had received, a special
guarantee against future German attacks in
the form of a defensive Alliance between France,
England, and America. The representatives at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Paris had agreed to this treaty, which definitely
pledged England and America to come again
to the help of France in case of another unprovoked
attack by Germany. The English Parliament
amid some protests, ratified the treaty,
but the United States Senate threw it out, and
therewith the treaty ceased to be binding on
England.</p>

<p>I think, after considerable hesitation, that
the rejection of the treaty was a misfortune.
Formally, no doubt, it was open to objection.
It seemed like an unnecessary excrescence
upon the Covenant of the League of Nations,
which already gave guarantees against war. It
contravened one of Mr. Wilson's principles,
and a very sound one, laid down on September
27, 1918: "Thirdly, there can be no leagues or
alliances or special covenants and understandings
within the general and common family of
the League of Nations." Yet the practical importance
of reassuring France was so urgent
that a little formal incorrectness might have
been worth incurring; and even formal incorrectness
could have been avoided by the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
expedient of making this guarantee to France
take the form of a special rider to Article XVI
of the Covenant.</p>

<p>That article provides: "Should any member
of the League resort to war in disregard of its
covenants under Articles XII, XIII, or XV, it
shall <i>ipso facto</i> be deemed to have committed
an act of war against all other members of the
League, which hereby undertake immediately
to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." To do what? One expects that they
will undertake to declare war, and this is what
the French wanted. But no. They only undertake
to apply an economic boycott to the offending
state, while the Council may "recommend
to the several Governments concerned
what effective military, naval, or air force they
shall severally contribute to the armed forces
to be used to protect the covenants of the
League." In case of a future attack by Germany
on France, France's late allies are bound
to boycott German trade, but are not explicitly
bound to give military help to France. I suggest
that it would have been possible for Great
Britain and America to add a rider stating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
specifically that in one of the cases contemplated
by this article, namely, an unprovoked attack
on France by Germany, they would not merely
proclaim a blockade and consider what to do
next, but would immediately and unconditionally
declare war. Such an undertaking
would involve some risk and be contrary to our
usual policy; but I am inclined to suggest that
the risk would have been worth taking.</p>

<p>However, this was not done. France was
left with the impression that if attacked she
could not count with confidence on the military
support of her late allies or of the other Powers
of the League. The result was disastrous. While
the rest of Europe, supported by a small but
generous and brilliant band of French radicals
and Socialists, considered the Treaty of Versailles
intolerably harsh, the dominant French
policy complained that it was inadequate for
her protection. The line of criticism was somewhat
as follows:</p>

<p>1. Germany should have been broken up.
No peace should have been made with Germany
as a whole, but separate treaties of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with Saxony, Bavaria, Westphalia, Prussia,
etc. These states should have been provided
with separate systems of coinage, postage, tariffs,
laws, etc., so as to make the diversity stable
and permanent. They should be forbidden
ever to unite. Also, France should have annexed
a large part of Germany; not up to the
Rhine&mdash;which was the view of Marshal Foch&mdash;but
up to the Elbe. The occupation of this
territory might impose a burden on France,
but burdens must be borne when such important
purposes are involved. And after all the
cost could be charged to the Germans! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>As this simple precaution was not taken, the
next best thing is to keep Germany weak.
Starve her by the blockade till sheer misery
produces a Bolshevik revolution and society
collapses in common ruin. Then apply the
indefinite indemnity, not from the desire to
get money, but to prevent Germany again
raising her head.</p>

<p>2. Since France's late allies cannot be relied
upon, she must make by diplomacy new allies
whose hands she can force, and who occupy a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
convenient geographical situation. Poland is
in just the right place. Let France help Poland
and stimulate Polish ambitions. She too is a
nation maddened by suffering and now dazzled
by success. A great imperialist Poland, on bad
terms with her neighbours, but backed by
France, will need a large and effective army,
and will be ready to strike at Germany's rear
the moment she attempts to move westward.
Unfortunately, Poland is apt to be on bad
terms with Russia; and as things now are Russia
is so much the enemy of the Entente that
she is thrown into the arms of Germany. That
is deplorable and must not be allowed to continue.
The Bolsheviks must be overthrown
and a Government set up in Russia which is
dependent for its existence on French support.
As an additional safeguard, perhaps it will be
necessary to secure a pro-French Hungary, to
back up the pro-French Poland. But we must
not despair yet of overthrowing the Bolsheviks.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, France herself needs more soldiers.
And she knows where to get them! The late
King Leopold of Belgium once said to M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Hanotaux, "Qu'est-ce que vous cherchez en Afrique,
vous autres Fran&ccedil;ais?" and M. Hanotaux replied,
"Sire, des soldats!" France during the
war established conscription in her African
territories and, in spite of a somewhat bloody
rebellion by the ignorant savages, who thought
the slave trade was being re&euml;stablished, succeeded
in importing to France a black army
which at one time numbered 600,000 fighting
men. With a little more energy and greatly
increased territories, that number might be
trebled. France is a smaller nation than Germany;
but France plus Algeria, Tunis, Morocco,
Senegambia, French Congo, and the new German
territories is a much larger nation than
Germany without colonies. And blacks fortunately
have not the same rights as white men!</p>

<p>A permanently wrecked Germany, vast
black armies for France, armed allies always
ready on Germany's eastern frontier; with these
conditions fulfilled, France, it is hoped by
these politicians, may at last breathe freely.</p>

<p><br /></p><hr style="width: 33%;" /><p><br /></p>

<p>What is wrong with this policy? You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
call it devilish, if you will, since it is based on
the deliberate and artificial creation of human
misery; but is it bad policy? After all, air-bombs
and poison gas and the like may be
called devilish. But, devilish or not, they have
sometimes to be used. If Germany is certainly
and confessedly looking out for the next opportunity
of escaping from the consequences of
the treaty and retrieving her fortunes on the
battlefield, is not France bound to take every
precaution to see that Germany shall never be
strong enough to do so with success? The next
war will be far worse than the last. The terms
imposed on the beaten party will be even more
desolating and destructive. France is probably
a less vigorous plant than her enemy. She has
failed to kill Germany, but Germany might
succeed in killing her.</p>

<p>It seems that Germany is absolutely bound
to fight, if there is no other way of recovering
her freedom and her right to live, while France
is absolutely bound to hold her enemy down
mercilessly, if there is no other way of securing
her own safety.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Solution" id="Solution"></a><span class="smcap">III. The Solution</span></h4>

<p>But perhaps after all there is. Last among the
Fourteen Points came the proposal to found
"A general Association of Nations under specific
covenants for the purpose of affording mutual
guarantees of political independence and
territorial integrity to small and great states
alike." The Treaty of Versailles has after all
two faces. It had to express two great waves of
feeling and two international necessities. Mr.
Wilson was not so utterly "bamboozled" as
Mr. Keynes would have us believe. General
Smuts and Lord Robert Cecil were not so utterly
without influence on the settlement. The
least depressing paragraphs in the Allied Reply
to the German delegation are those in which
they explain that the terrific severity of the
greater part of the treaty applies only to a
"transition period" of punishment, of reparation
and of trial, at the end of which they see
the realization of Mr. Wilson's promises. "The
conditions of peace contain some provisions
for the future which may outlast the transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
period during which the economic balance"&mdash;between
Germany and the invaded countries&mdash;"is
to be restored; and a reciprocity is foreseen
after that period which is very clearly that
equality of trade conditions for which President
Wilson has stipulated." The phrasing of
the paragraph is awkward, but the main drift
is clear. The Fourteen Points are accepted, but
adjourned; when Germany has been punished
and reparation made, they will come into force.
"The Allied and Associated Powers look forward
to the time when the League of Nations
established by this treaty shall extend its membership
to all peoples." "They see no reason
why Germany should not become a member of
the League in the early future," provided she
satisfies certain tests. "It has never been their
intention that Germany or any other Power
should be indefinitely excluded from the
League of Nations." They are convinced that
the Covenant of the League "introduces an
element of progress into the relations of peoples
which will develop and strengthen to the
advantage of justice and of peace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>This is as it should be; but the world does not
stand still while Germany is making reparation
and being taught gradually to love her chastisers.
If the League "introduces an element of
progress," the sooner it gets to work the better.
It is only too clear that every month which
passes with the League entirely dominated by
England, France, and Italy encourages and
deepens the suspicion with which the League is
regarded by its critics. I say nothing of American
criticisms, in which many factors co&ouml;perate.
But the Swiss Federal Council, in the very
able and persuasive message which it issued to
the Assembly on February 17, 1920, in favour
of joining the League, has to deal with this suspicion.
"One has been tempted at times to consider
the League as an alliance of the conquerors
against the conquered. The fact that Germany,
Austria, and the former Russian Empire
remain provisionally excluded from the League
may have given a semblance of truth to this
manner of thinking." The suspicion is afterwards
described as "this apparently accurate
criticism." Switzerland as a whole has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
fortunately rejected the suspicion and by a small
majority joined the League. But in most of
Central Europe the League of Nations movement
is strangled in its birth by the general
feeling that the present League means merely
the Entente Powers and their clients, and the
elements for starting a counter-league are consolidating
month by month. This counter-league
would probably not be an open and confessed
alliance. But Russia, Germany, and the
United States are still outside, and there are
many unpaid grudges amongst the Moslems of
Asia. The test which is exacted by Article I
from any new state desiring to become a member
of the League is that "it shall give effective
guarantees of its sincere intention to observe its
international obligations." Interpreted with
theological strictness, this would probably result
in the rejection of all candidates, to say
nothing of the expulsion of many of the original
members. Perfect sincerity in observing unpleasant
obligations is not a common characteristic
of human societies. But in the ordinary
sense of the words the test is already satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
by Germany and Austria and most of the succession
states. The Assembly of the League
meets for the first time on November 15, 1920.
It ought not to dissolve without admitting to
its membership Germany and Austria, as well
as several other candidates who have already
applied. At the moment of writing (November,
1920), Lord Grey, Lord Selborne, and
Mr. Barnes have issued a joint appeal for the
immediate admission of Germany, which has
long been the accepted policy of the League of
Nations Union. There are many obstacles, but
the result will doubtless be known before these
words are in print. Fortunately, the admission
of new members is decided by a two-thirds majority
of the Assembly and does not require a
unanimous vote. Once the League is established
on a broad base, including the conquered
nations on equal terms with the victorious, the
prospect of that war of revenge which has
hitherto seemed almost inevitable will dwindle
and become remote.</p>

<p><br /></p><hr style="width: 33%;" /><p><br /></p>

<p>The hope expressed above has not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
realized. Austria, Bulgaria, and many less important
states applied for admission to the League
and were accepted, but French feeling was
known to be very strong, and Germany did not
even apply. Had she done so she would probably
have had a majority in her favour, and it
was considered until the beginning of March,
1921, that she was certain of admission at the
next meeting of the Assembly in September.
But in the meantime untoward events have
taken place.</p>

<p>The French Government, like the English, obtained
success at the elections by wild promises
to make Germany pay all the costs of the war.
As M. Poincar&eacute; has observed, "the French people
will not understand how the victors in a
great war can be on the verge of bankruptcy."
Consequently they think their rulers are cheating
them. Educated people, in France as in
England, have long since ceased to expect much
from German indemnities, but the Governments
still depend on their appeal to mob-psychology;
and it was believed that if M. Briand
ventured to make any concessions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
direction of reason or moderation he would lose
his majority in the Chamber. The proposals
made at the Inter-Allied Conference at Brussels
and drawn up by the French expert, M.
Seydoux, had been silently dropped as unsatisfying;
the subsequent British proposals made
at Boulogne had been rejected for the same
reason. It was necessary, however, to make
some definite proposals to Germany without
much further delay, since the treaty had laid
down May 1, 1921, as the time for a settlement.
Germany was by that time to have paid a thousand
million pounds on account, and was to
learn the extent, finite or infinite, of the total
bill. Mr. Lloyd George, as might have been expected,
showed much sympathy with M. Briand
in his awkward position, and agreed to
a demand for reparations on a scale which
was obviously fantastic. It began, reasonably
enough, with a system of annuities, though the
first figure was probably too high and the last
figures can scarcely have been meant seriously.
Germany was to pay &pound;150,000,000 a year for
the first five years; then the annual sum was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
increase at intervals for the extraordinary period
of forty-two years, towards the end of
which time Germany was expected to pay annually
&pound;300,000,000, or half as much again
every year as the total indemnity exacted from
France after the war of 1870. Even that was
not enough for a population which had been
sedulously fed on lies by a class of politician
who at times seem to possess among them no
single sane and honest man. And an additional
payment was demanded of a yearly sum equivalent
to a duty of twelve per cent <i>ad valorem</i> on
all German exports.</p>

<p>Opinion in Germany was sharply divided.
All they had to pay with was an enormous
deficit on the Budget, with the prospect of presently
losing the Silesian coal-mines and having
prohibitive duties placed by the Allies upon
their exports. One party insisted that the Government
should make no promise which it could
not expect to perform; another, that what Germany
wanted was peace, and that they had
better sign anything required of them. The
first party, on the whole, carried the day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
German delegation in London made a counter-proposal
based, very sensibly, on the idea of
finding the present value of the forty-two-year
annuities and raising that sum by means of a
loan; but as they worked out the idea they
favoured Germany on every detailed calculation
to an extent which they must have known
to be unacceptable. Apparently they expected
a long and serious bargaining march. But, to
most people's surprise, Mr. George leapt with
alacrity at the prospect of a rupture. The proposal
was rejected with every semblance of virtuous
indignation. No time was allowed for the
delegation to consult the German Government.
A hurried second proposal, to pay the terms
demanded for five years and then have the
matter reconsidered, was tossed aside without
consideration, and French and British troops
proceeded to invade Germany, occupy more
territory, and set up a new and artificial customs-barrier
in the most unsuitable places, at
which they proceeded themselves to collect the
German customs.</p>

<p>The plan is very expensive, and utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
unprofitable. It involves a straining if not a
breach of the treaty,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and it is likely, if any untoward
event occurs, to provoke a war of the
most humiliating and embittered kind&mdash;the
war of a desperate and helpless population trying
to rid themselves of foreign oppressors. But
it has saved M. Briand's Government. If he
had agreed to accept any German terms whatever,
he would have been upset for not exacting
more. But if he marches French and British
troops into the heart of Germany no one can
accuse him of lack of spirit. So for the present
all is well; and as for the future, it is conceivable
that the Germans will give way and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
some impossible promise. That will increase
M. Briand's prestige. It is more likely that they
will simply sit still and let the Allied armies do
their worst. Then there will be a chance of
carrying out one of the darling aims of the
French chauvinists, and annexing, or at least
separating from Germany, all the German provinces
which they occupy.</p>

<p>In face of these lunatic proceedings the German
Government has behaved with considerable
dignity and good sense, though naturally
the German newspapers are running a little
wild. It has announced its intention of appealing
to the Assembly of the League of Nations,
and although, not being a member, Germany
cannot herself raise the subject, it may be taken
as certain that some member will take it up
on her behalf. This produces a most critical
situation.</p>

<p>According to the Covenant, Article III, the
Assembly may be summoned to meet "from
time to time as occasion may require." But
presumably it is the Council which decides
whether occasion does require it or not, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
one can expect the Council to favour Germany's
appeal. The appeal will only be considered
when the Assembly has its next regular meeting
in September. We shall then see whether
the Assembly possesses the force and courage
necessary to discuss freely and, if necessary,
to condemn the actions of the two leading European
Powers; or if the two can successfully
silence all criticism. For my own part I think
the discussion will take place; and that, for the
first time since the war, the voice of an impartial
third party wilt be heard in discussing the
terms imposed on Germany by her conquerors.
That does not mean the realization of the "enthronement
of public right on the common
law of nations," but it is one of the first steps
toward it.</p>

<p><br /></p><hr style="width: 33%;" /><p><br /></p>

<p>The League of Nations is in a position to say
to France: "You are afraid of another attack
by Germany; and to avert that danger you propose
in various ways to follow a policy which
will plunge Europe into continued distress. We
hereby guarantee you against attack. Thirty-nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
nations at present, who will shortly be increased
to fifty-one, if not more, have signed a
definite and unqualified contract to preserve
your 'existing political independence and territorial
integrity' against any 'external aggression';
and further, if you are attacked in such a
way as not actually to threaten your territory
or independence, all the States of the League
will consider that an act of war has been committed
against themselves, will apply the complete
economic boycott to your enemy, and arrange
plans for giving you immediate military
support. We offer you here a far more effective
guarantee of safety than you can possibly attain
by your own diplomacy. But we demand in
return that your foreign policy shall be frankly
and sincerely a League of Nations policy; that
you shall not make secret treaties, not set up inequitable
tariffs, not plot the ruin of your late
enemies or any other people; but work as a
loyal member of the League with a view to the
welfare of the whole."</p>

<p>The League says to Germany: "You complain
of the undue severity of the treaty and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
impossibility of carrying out its economic provisions.
Commissions already exist, and you
have taken part in them, for discussing these
latter and fixing the terms of the reparation
which you owe. But, beyond that, if there is
any clause in the treaty which appears to any
member of the League as 'threatening to disturb
international peace or the good understanding
between nations upon which peace depends,'
it will, under Article XI, be brought before the
League and considered. Further, if any clause
in the treaty appears to 'have become inapplicable'
or to give rise to 'international conditions
which might endanger the peace of the
world,' under Article XXIII the Assembly of
the League may at any time 'advise their reconsideration.'
You complain that the terms of the
present treaty were imposed upon you, without
discussion, by implacable enemies who had
you at their mercy; that you have been made a
sort of outlaw nation, without freedom, without
colonies, without ships, sitting apart while the
world is administered by your enemies. But
at our Assembly table you will sit as an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and free member, with the same rights as those
who were lately your conquerors. We submit
to you that this gives you a far better chance
of improving your condition than another war
could. Your lot must be for some time a hard
one. That is inevitable, and we cannot think it
unjust. You challenged the Entente to war,
you staked all on victory, and you were beaten.
Now you have to make reparation. But the recuperative
power of a great nation is immense;
and wherever you have been subjected to a definitely
unjust or dangerous condition, we offer
you a remedy. Wherever you may have a dispute
with any other Power, we offer you a Court
of Arbitration as impartially constituted as the
wit of man could devise."</p>

<p><br /></p><hr style="width: 33%;" /><p><br /></p>

<p>At present neither party quite believes this
guarantee. If they did, it would probably be
enough for them. It used to be said of Sir Edward
Grey in the Balkan Conferences that he
was not only sincere; he had the power of making
other people see that he was sincere. If Europe
is to be saved from new Great Wars, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Powers of the League must first of all be sincere
in their undertakings, and next, they must convince
the world in general of their sincerity. To
that subject we must return later.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h4>

<h3>THE EAST</h3>

<p>But the world is not merely threatened by the
prospect of future wars. It is filled with wars at
the present moment. There are quarrels and
bickerings between most of the newly liberated
states in eastern Europe; there is a war, sometimes
avowed and sometimes underground, between
Communist Russia and all her neighbours
and rivals, a war whose tentacles reach
far throughout Europe and Asia; and there are
wars against the British and French in various
parts of the East. Let us briefly touch upon a
few sample cases.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Syria" id="Syria"></a>I. <span class="smcap">Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and India</span></h4>

<p>The simplest case is Syria. In 1915, during the
war, a Syrian National Committee, including
representatives from Damascus and Mosul, negotiated
with us through Sherif Husein, and
we signed a document promising to "recognize
and uphold Arab independence" in an area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
including the whole of Arabia, Palestine, Syria,
and Mesopotamia, except (1) Aden and (2) the
Syrian coast. Within the independent area we
merely claimed for ourselves "a measure of administrative
control" in Bagdad and Bosra&mdash;not
in Mosul&mdash;and reserved any special interests
of France. The French were informed of
the negotiations immediately. They expressed
themselves content with the possession of the
Syrian coast, and agreed in our promises to
Husein. On the strength of this agreement the
Hejaz revolted, and Feisul's army, consisting
mainly of Syrian and Mesopotamian soldiers
who had formerly been in the Turkish service,
fought as our allies to the end of the war. An
attempted rising in Syria proper was crushed
with great severity by the Turks.</p>

<p>In 1918 the Syrians welcomed the Entente
armies as liberators, and were again promised
their national independence, though this time it
was to be under the guidance of one of the Entente
Powers as mandatory. They asked that
the mandatory should be England, but England
had too much on her hands. The Syrians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
next asked for America; but America refused
all mandates. France, meantime, had always
claimed special rights in Syria, and England by
a treaty made during the war had recognized
Syria as a French interest. If they must be under
France, the Syrian representatives specially
demanded pledges that the government should
be a civil government, that a certain degree
of independence should be allowed to the natives,
and that the country should not be occupied
by French troops. How far these pledges
were given and broken by the French; how far
it was only we ourselves who gave assurances
which we had neither the right nor the power
to carry out, and thus unconsciously deceived
Feisul, these are questions still in dispute. It
seems unfortunately certain that the Syrians
considered themselves betrayed. In the end,
Syria was occupied by French troops; the native
government was not recognized, but dispersed;
there were raids and pitched battles,
and the Emir Feisul, one of our most popular
heroes during the Great War, was expelled from
his throne and country. He is now an exile, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was for a time officially forbidden to land in
England.</p>

<p>France so far has neither accepted nor asked
for any mandate from the League of Nations,
and appears not fully to realize the obligations
undertaken by her in signing the Covenant of
the League, or the pledge repeated in the Reply
of the Allied Powers to Germany, "that the
Mandatory Powers, in so far as they may be appointed
trustees by the League of Nations, will
derive no benefits from such trusteeship."</p>

<p>In Mesopotamia the British established
themselves during the war after a long and
chequered campaign by defeating the Turks
and capturing Bagdad. The Indian soldiers
and officials who were in command showed the
most praiseworthy zeal and energy in proceeding
at once to develop the country: to drain
and irrigate, to plant crops, to establish order
and good government in regions which had not
known such things since a remote antiquity.
The English were welcomed as liberators and
made explicit promises to set up an independent
Arab kingdom under a "measure of British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
administrative control." So much propagandist
literature was poured forth on the glories of
the independent Arab nation which the English
were to create, that serious discontent was
caused in Egypt. "Is a half-naked Arab to
have independence, and am I not good enough
to have even self-government?" wrote a highly
educated Egyptian to a British official. Meantime
the actual government of Mesopotamia
became more and more severely effective, and
remained entirely concentrated in the hands of
the British. The expenses were enormous and
the rate of taxation per head appears to have
risen to four times what it had been under the
Turks. The productivity of the country, however,
was so great as to hold out a prospect of
almost making up the loss, and the important
oil-wells at Mosul were expected to do so completely.
The native cultivators profited by the
improved harvests and the increased area of
cultivation, and the expenses of government
were in part to be met out of the future oil
profits. And the best British administrators
were certainly beloved by their people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The educated classes in Bagdad, the sheikhs
and the ex-Turkish officials, became restive at
the high taxation and the indefinite delay of
"Arab independence." The turbulent desert
tribes and the disorderly elements in general
were disgusted at the good policing. But there
was no general discontent, because personal
assurances were given to leading Arabs that
the Covenant of the League of Nations, which
Great Britain had signed, laid down definitely
that Mesopotamia was to be recognized provisionally
as an independent nation and that the
mandate was to be given to Great Britain.
There would be, it was promised, a native Government
with a British Resident to advise it,
as in an Indian native state. Doubtless the
Government would also ask for other help
from England, especially in the matter of public
works, irrigation, and the engineering of the
oil-wells.</p>

<p>But the League issued no mandate. According
to rumour, it had offered a scheme of mandate
to the Great Powers concerned, and one
at least of them had refused the terms. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
precious oil, it was discovered, had already
been divided by a private treaty between
France and England, which left only a small
fraction for the Mesopotamians and none for
the rest of the world. There was no attempt to
set up an Arab Government. Some beginnings
were occasionally made of associating Arab
officials with the Englishmen who did the real
work of governing. But they were not whole-hearted.
A letter was accidentally divulged in
which an English soldier said of the high Arab
official attached to him, "I will soon make him
lick my boots." There were symptoms of disaffection,
non-payment of taxes, the resurgence
of old discredited Turkish and German agents,
open rebellions. And the Government replied
by numerous executions and punitive expeditions.
The bombing aeroplane, which had revealed
itself as a very convenient weapon of
war, proved an utterly disastrous instrument
of police. The British liberators, who had come
by the special desire of the population to establish
a free Arab nation helped by friendly advice
from British Residents, ended, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
to Colonel Lawrence's estimate, in killing ten
thousand Arabs and setting the whole country
in a blaze of war. An army of over one hundred
thousand men is now reconquering it. And at
the same time, perhaps at the eleventh hour
and perhaps too late altogether, that section in
the British Government which believed in the
League of Nations and wished scrupulously to
carry out in victory the pledges it had given in
time of distress, prevailed to bring about a definite
change of policy. Sir Percy Cox and Mr.
Philby were sent to Mesopotamia with instructions,
so it was stated, to reverse the previous
policy and try to set up that independent Arab
Government which we had promised in 1915
and again in 1917, and ought to have set working
before the end of 1919. The "rebellion"
will doubtless be crushed, and the native Government
may or not be successfully organized.
There is a strong desire among the Arab leaders
to have it based on a treaty of alliance with
Great Britain after the Egyptian model, and
not on Article XXII of the Covenant. In any
case the task is infinitely more difficult than it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
was before so much blood was shed, and the
original friendship of the Arabs turned to hatred.
On simple men executive action makes a
much deeper impression than policy. In Mesopotamia
our policy itself was bad because it
was not consistent. It was a muddle of two
contradictory policies, resulting in confusion
and hypocrisy. But the executive action seems
to have been such as to make the chances of
even the best policy very precarious. A government
which multiplies the taxes by four and
shoots and hangs its subjects in batches is seldom
excused because of its good drainage or its
progressive ideas.</p>

<p>The story in Egypt is shorter and perhaps
less unhappy, but essentially similar. Early in
the war, when Turkey joined the enemy, we
declared a British protectorate over Egypt,
accompanied by a promise to give the country
independence or free institutions at the end
of the war. This in itself was a perfectly good
and defensible policy, though, to be correct, it
should have had the concurrence of Egypt.
But in the course of the war Egypt became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
full of discontent. Experienced officials were
wanted elsewhere, and inexperienced substitutes
made mistakes. Labour in great quantities
was required for the Army, and was obtained
through native contractors or headmen,
who practised the ordinary Oriental methods
of extortion and corruption while professing to
act by orders of the English. The peasant who
was dragged off to forced labour, or compelled
to buy his freedom by heavy bribes, blamed
the British for both. At one time Egypt was
garrisoned by large numbers of Australian
troops, who had the habit of thinking of all
Asiatics as "blackfellows," and whose ways of
dealing with "blackfellows" were not of the
gentlest. The seed was thus sown of a passionate
hatred, partly just and partly unjust; and
feeling was already ripe for explosion when it
transpired at the end of the war that the British
Government had no apparent intention of
fulfilling their promise to confer on Egypt
"free institutions." Open rebellion was impossible,
owing to the presence of overpowering
numbers of British troops; but a time of danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and infinite trouble, well controlled by Lord
Allenby, led at last to the appointment of a
Commission under Lord Milner, which grasped
its almost desperate problem with great courage
and skill.</p>

<p>Among other curious misfortunes, it turned
out that the word "protectorate" had been
translated into Arabic by a term which denoted
the sort of protection that is extended to an
outcast or a person with no national rights.
The Commissioners were met on their arrival
by a universal boycott, and by constant threats
of assassination. They lived in considerable
danger, and no Egyptian would be seen speaking
to them. But tact and patience gradually
broke down the boycott; and a much larger
measure of agreement was obtained with
Zaghlul and the moderate Nationalists than
had at the outset seemed possible. After inquiry,
the Commission has taken the line of
recommending, first, the cancellation of the
Capitulations, or special privileges granted to
European states, which have paralyzed the
progress of Egypt for several generations; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
separation from Egypt of the Canal zone, as
a special British interest and of vital importance
to the Empire; the retention of British
advisers in two posts, the ministries of Justice
and of Finance&mdash;a safeguard without which
the European Powers would not consent to
forgo the special protection of the Capitulations;
and in other respects the establishment
of Egypt as an independent national state. As
far as is possible to forecast, it looks as if this
settlement would succeed.</p>

<p>The history of recent events in India is too
large and complicated a subject to be dealt
with here. But in its main outline it has been
curiously similar to that of the other regions of
the East. A wonderful response from almost
the whole continent to the need of Great Britain
during the war; blunders of the War Office
and reactions of discontent; German propaganda;
Turkish and Pan-Islamic intrigue; repressive
Press Acts and Conspiracy Acts; passive
resistance, dangerous riots, and widespread
conspiracies; the severe and sometimes lawless
coercion of the Punjab; the savage massacre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Amritsar, and at last, amid great obstructions
and hesitations, the passing of the Montagu-Chelmsford
Act and the conferring of a new
and liberal constitution upon India. It is the
same story as in Egypt and Mesopotamia.
So much time was wasted in doing the wrong
thing, that when at last resort was had to the
right thing the right time was past. The Indian
Government was faced with great difficulties
and very real dangers. Its errors have
been so signal and notorious that public opinion
is apt to forget or ignore the admirable skill
and patience with which most officials steered
their districts through periods of extreme
strain. But reforms long promised were delayed
until too late. The executive plunged into excesses
which will not be forgotten for centuries.
And when the long-hoped-for reforms at last
have come, it may be that they come to a people
too exasperated to give them a fair trial.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Eastern_Policy" id="Eastern_Policy"></a>II. <span class="smcap">An Eastern Policy</span></h4>

<p>The policies here described have been so full
of errors that it is hard to derive from them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
very clear moral. Government without principle
has many conveniences; if life consisted of
isolated moments it might be entirely successful.
But life is continuous, and human beings
have memories and expectations. And almost
any policy that is continuous and consistent
and true to itself is more likely to succeed in
the end than a mixture of momentary expedients
and plunges for safety. It is conceivable
that a perfectly resolute and unfaltering military
coercion of India, Egypt, and Mesopotamia
might have succeeded. But such a policy,
if it was ever possible, is certainly so no
longer; and also it would hardly be a policy for
avoiding international strife. And that is the
subject we are considering.</p>

<p>If we look below the mistakes of policy and
administration committed by the British or
French Governments, we find underneath the
surface a profound and instinctive resentment
of the Moslem East against the Western Powers.
The Western Powers, which for convenience
we term Christian, have been for some
centuries far more efficient than any Moslem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
state. The West has increasingly taken charge
of the East; beaten it, managed it, "run" it,
governed it, and in some cases exploited it.
Western government, or at least British government,
has been just, incorruptible, impartial,
strong, intelligent, far beyond ordinary Eastern
standards. It may have been unsympathetic
and grossly expensive; it may, in spite
of the unexampled personal integrity of the
whole governing class, have led to the presence
in Eastern countries of undesirable money-seekers.
But it has been, on the whole, essentially
and undeniably good, efficient government,
backed by a military power which committed
few excesses, lived on its own pay, and
never failed in an emergency. No one who
studies even superficially the history of average
Oriental governments, from Morocco or
Bokhara to Oudh, can be surprised or sorry
that they have been superseded by the better
governments of the West. The peoples of the
East themselves have gained by Western penetration;
nay, more, they are conscious of their
need of the West. But they have had too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of it; they resent it, and they are frightened
of it. The Moslem nations have lost their independence
one after another. At the beginning
of the Great War only one Moslem Power
remained free and powerful&mdash;the Turkish
Empire. At the end of the war there was not
one.</p>

<p>The Turks were not popular in the East.
The Syrians and Arabs hated them almost as
much as their Christian subjects did. The
Turkish peasants of Anatolia suffered cruelly
under the exactions of Constantinople, especially
in the matter of military service. But all
through the Moslem East ran the consciousness
that the Sultan, with all his faults, was their
own man. He was the acknowledged Head of
the great majority of Moslems in the world.
He was, above all, the last barrier that seemed
to protect them from the overwhelming flood of
Western aggression, and the last great Moslem
figure which enabled them to preserve their
self-respect.</p>

<p>While the Turkish Empire stood, the Moslem
peoples, though fallen on evil days, could think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of Islam as an independent and even an imperial
entity. In places, doubtless, they had to
kiss the feet of dogs; but their Caliph still ruled
masses of Christian subject populations and
still was master of the capital city of the world.
With the fall of Turkey, the last free Moslem
state was gone. Not here and there, but everywhere
throughout the whole world, the faithful
were set beneath the heel of these rich, drunken,
pork-eating idolaters with their indecent women,
their three Gods, and their terrific material
civilization. "Pan-Islamism," as Mr.
Toynbee says, "is only an extreme example of
the feeling at the back of almost any modern
Oriental movement we may examine. It may
take aggressive forms, but the essence of it is a
defensive impulse. Its appeal is to fear, and if
the fear of the West could be lifted from off
the minds of the Oriental peoples, its mainspring
would be gone."</p>

<p>The problem of our Eastern policy is to remove
that fear. And that ought not to be so
very difficult. The essential fact to grasp is
that the East needs us far more than we need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the East. We need markets; but that idea is
only suggested to us by the fact that Eastern
peoples want our goods. We do almost everything
better than they do. They want our
textiles, our knives and tools, our engines and
ploughs, our books, our learning. They cannot
make railways or ships without us. They cannot
work their mines or oil-wells except by
Western help. They cannot really govern their
countries satisfactorily without European advisers.
The language of Article XXII of the
League of Nations Covenant is quite correct
when it says that "Certain communities formerly
belonging to the Turkish Empire have
reached a stage of development where their
existence as independent nations can be provisionally
recognized, subject to the rendering
of administrative advice and assistance by a
mandatory until such time as they are able to
stand alone." At present "they are not yet
able to stand by themselves under the strenuous
conditions of the modern world."</p>

<p>They ought to want us, and if left alone they
would want us. We have frightened them into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
fighting and hating us by forcing ourselves upon
them instead of waiting to be asked. We have
conferred incalculable benefits on India: the
benefit of protection from invasion, of comparative
protection from plague and famine, of social
order, of administrative justice, to say
nothing of roads and railways, and the enlivening
force of Western knowledge. We have immensely
increased the prosperity of Egypt, we
have put down all kinds of Oriental abuses and
protected the fellaheen against <i>corv&eacute;es</i> and extortions
and tortures. We were in process of beginning
to perform the same services for Mesopotamia.
But in the latter regions at any rate&mdash;for
in India our roots are far deeper and the
problem is more complex&mdash;the people did not
want us. We only held them and did them good
by force. And the chief reason why they did not
want us was fear. We came to them with machine
guns and bombing planes as conquerors
and masters, having destroyed the only free
Moslem Power; and they found it difficult to believe
in our good intentions. We came to them,
most unfortunately, also with specious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
promises which we made in time of need and broke
in the days of victory.</p>

<p>The right policy is something very easy to
state and extremely difficult to carry out, even
for a single-minded and clear-headed Government.
It needs first, perhaps, an effort of imaginative
understanding more far-reaching than
has ever yet in history been demanded of an Imperial
Power. Only those who understand the
East can win the respect and confidence of the
East. But in the meantime, if we cannot fully
understand, there is a way at least to make ourselves
understood. Justice is the passport to
confidence all the world over. And our first
business is to act quite simply and sincerely up
to all our engagements. We undertook certain
obligations when we signed Article XXII of the
Covenant. We should make the "wishes of these
communities a principal consideration" in deciding
whether we should go to them at all. We
should really treat them "as independent nations,"
and should honestly give them "administrative
advice and assistance until they shall
be able to stand alone." And we should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
allow our minds to be confused by thoughts of
gain, nor our advice to take the form of horse,
foot, and artillery. Two illustrations may make
this point clear. An experienced and very successful
administrator was asked a few weeks
ago whether he would accept the post of adviser
to a certain Moslem Government. He
said, "Yes, upon one condition. That there is
no British army anywhere in the country."
That is the right and wise spirit. The second is
even simpler. One of the most obvious and
matter-of-course obligations laid upon imperial
administrators and civil servants is that they
shall not embark in trade or in any way make
a profit out of the administration of their office.
That is the right rule. The Empire should set
an example of the behaviour that it expects
from its best servants.</p>

<p>When we apportioned to ourselves the German
colonies, we specially declined to take over
their public debts. And when protest was raised
against this proceeding, we stated definitely
in our official Reply: "It would be unjust to
make this responsibility rest on the Mandatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Powers, which, in so far as they may be appointed
trustees by the League of Nations, will
derive no benefit from such trusteeship." Is it
entirely quixotic and idealist to hope that, even
in post-war conditions, a great nation may remain
true to her word?</p>

<p>It seems at least as if the only alternative
was to hold these Eastern territories by armed
force, and that is no longer possible. It might
be possible to hold by force India alone, or
Egypt alone, or Mesopotamia alone. It is not
possible so to hold all three. We must govern
by consent of the governed or not all.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h4>

<h3>RUSSIA AND ITS BORDERS</h3>

<p>Another group of wars and threats of war has
its centre in Moscow. All the States on the borders
of Russia&mdash;Finland, Lithuania, Poland,
the Ukraine, Hungary, Rumania, the new republics
of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan,
and the kingdom of Persia&mdash;are either at war
or in fear of war or just recovering from war
with Russia, or from civil war fomented by Russian
agents and propagandists. Inside Russia
itself, civil war has never ceased since the first
outbreak of the Revolution in 1917. It is true
that the civil war has been largely helped by
foreign munitions and stirred up by foreign
intrigues. But that only shows that&mdash;as the
world is now organized&mdash;there is something
in the present Russian Government which
makes foreigners as well as Russians wish to
take up arms against it. It may have been&mdash;I
think strongly that it was&mdash;exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
unwise for the foreign Governments to intervene
in the domestic troubles of Russia, but
no one can pretend that the civil war was entirely
created by foreigners. The rebellions
were there before the foreigners joined in, and
it is even thought by good judges that the opposition
to the Bolsheviks might by this time
have been successful if it had not been damned
in Russian eyes by its foreign alliances.</p>

<p>For us the question is how the Russian Revolution
has become such a plenteous and intense
cause of strife. It is, of course, impossible to
pass judgment on the whole of a vast movement
with the very inadequate information
that is now accessible to an average Englishman
about Russia. Even the French Revolution,
which has been studied by thousands of
observers and historians, is not yet judged.
The sum of infamies and high achievements is
too complicated to add up. And the Russian
Revolution is probably even harder to value
than the French.</p>

<h4><a name="Civil_War" id="Civil_War"></a>I. <span class="smcap">The Civil War</span></h4>

<p>It would be a mistake to forget the elements
of simple early-Christian brotherhood which
seem to characterize the Russian peasant. It
was well known before the war how the members
of a workmen's <i>artel</i>, or trade community,
when trade was bad, would divide their earnings
equally and all starve, if need be, together,
without any attempt by the luckier workmen
to save themselves at the expense of the others.
The glowing descriptions of Mr. Stephen
Graham cannot be entirely without any basis
in fact. And the people of Tolstoy and Dostoievsky
have evidently a most rare capacity
for sainthood and martyrdom, as well as for
aberration of mind. Present-day Russia has
been described by an eminent Socialist as "a
nation of artists governed by brutes," and the
phrase is probably true of the old Russia also,
and the Russia of centuries back. Communism
comes easily in Russia, and so does submission
to tyranny.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered that the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
War, among its many aspects, involved the
most frightful and bewildering oppression of
the poor and weak. As was said quite truly:
"Millions of poor men in divers regions of the
world have been dragged suddenly and without
any previous action of their own into a quarrel
which they neither made nor desired nor understood,
and in the course of that quarrel have
been subjected again and again to the very extremity
of possible human suffering." The war
naturally and inevitably created in Europe a
passionate wish for some revolutionary transformation
of a world in which rich and clever
people in parliaments and governments had the
power of inflicting such pains upon the poor.
The peculiarity of the Bolshevik movement
was, as one of its rare English admirers puts it,
not so much that it wanted a particular kind
of Socialism or Communism, but that it wanted
it <i>now</i>. The world has seen many revolutions
and many Socialist governments; but they have
never really established that paradise of the
poor which was advertised in their prospectuses
and doubtless nursed in their hopes. Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
failed altogether. And those which succeeded
went wrong. They co&ouml;perated with "bourgeois
Liberals." They extended the franchise,
they improved the condition of the working
classes, they established well-to-do workmen
and peasants with a stake in the country and a
conservative bias; but they never really did
what was wanted. They always stopped short.
They developed the middle-class virtues. They
left still in existence a capitalist class which
preached the merits of thrift and hard work and
was interested in trade; and of course they left
always somewhere an oppressed class. The under
dog was still under.</p>

<p>The Bolshevik remedy was very direct and
simple. It was to disarm everybody who had
any share in prosperity, and distribute firearms
to those who had nothing else. Only when he
was armed and the rest of the people unarmed
could the real proletarian&mdash;the man who had
no savings, no talent, no education, no notable
good qualities, nothing that makes for success in
life&mdash;hope to beat the men who always outstripped
him. It is strange that even in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
moment of extreme misery such a theory could
have established itself in any country as a principle
of government. But the military collapse
of Russia gave it a unique chance. The common
soldiers, anxious to fight no more, already
possessed arms. They had merely to murder
their officers and the thing was done. The rest
of the population was unarmed and helpless.
And meantime the peasants, though almost untouched
by revolutionary ideas, were amenable
to one particular bribe. The revolutionaries
offered all the peasants of Russia their masters'
land without any payment. They could
simply take the land, and kill or not kill the
owner as they pleased. There was no punishment
for such killing. According to strict Communist
principles, the land was not to remain
in the peasants' possession. It was to be the
property of the State. But this principle had to
be dropped in order to induce the peasants to
co&ouml;perate with the revolutionary town workmen.
Whatever may be said in favour of this
revolution, there can at least be no surprise at
what Lenin calls "the frantic resistance" of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
upper and middle classes of Russia. The policy
of the Government was announced on January
23, 1919: "The present is the period of destruction
and crushing of the capitalist system of the
whole world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In order to establish the dictatorship
of the proletariate it is necessary to
disarm the bourgeoisie and its agents and to
arm the proletariate." It is to be dictatorship
in the strict sense: the power of a man with a
gun to do what he likes with those who have no
guns. There is to be no democracy or representation
of the dispossessed classes. If they were
represented they might recover power. Only
those known to be faithful to the new Government
are to vote. All persons of property must
be dispossessed, from landlords to small shop-keepers.
Rich peasants must go; even "middle
peasants" at one time had to go; only the
poorest peasants and the poorest town workmen
should rule, assisted, of course, by those
educated people who would accept the new
r&eacute;gime and establish by deeds beyond doubt
their hatred of the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>The control of a country by a small minority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
is always difficult. It needs methods of "terror."
But this minority had first to acquire the
control and then to maintain it. Its task was
more difficult and its methods had to be more
violent than those of its predecessors. The
"terror" of the old Czarist Government or of
the French Revolution must be superseded by
the more drastic method of what was called
"mass terror." The secret police, whose activities
had made hideous the record of the
Czarist Government, and who had fled for
their lives at the first outbreak of the Lvof and
Kerensky Revolution, returned from their
lurking-places to put themselves at the disposal
of the Bolsheviks. This legion of devils
had something to sell which the new Government
badly needed. On the analogy of the
<i>Comit&eacute; de Salut Public</i> there was established
the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission
for stamping out all trace of resistance to the
new order. Spies were placed everywhere
(Proclamation, October 17, 1918). No distinction
was to be made between Czarist reactionaries
and unorthodox Socialists, such as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries (<i>Russkaya
Zhizn</i>, May 10, 1919). Enormous numbers
of "hostages" were arrested. At any sign
of conspiracy outside, large numbers of these
were shot. The assassination of the Bolshevik
Uritzky was repaid by the execution of five
hundred citizens. Yet, just as in the most furious
days of the French Revolution, the terrorists
were always complaining that there was
not enough terror. "The continual discovery
of conspiracies in our rear .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the insignificant
extent of serious repressions and mass shootings
of White Guards and bourgeoisie on the
part of the Soviets, show that notwithstanding
frequent pronouncements urging mass terror
against the Social Revolutionaries, White
Guards, and bourgeoisie, no real terror exists"
(Official Weekly of the All-Russian Extraordinary
Commission, No. 1, Moscow, September
21, 1918).</p>

<p>Trotzky in comforting language explained
that the object of the mass terror was not really
the extermination of all non-communists, or all
Russians who did not attain the full standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of poverty and orthodoxy. "The proletariate
says: 'I shall break your will because my will
is stronger than yours, and I shall force you
to serve me.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Terror as the demonstration
of the will and strength of the working class
is historically justified" (Trotzky in <i>Izvestia</i>,
January 10, 1919). Eventually, of course,
when all Russia was submissive and all Europe
Communist, there would be a gentler r&eacute;gime,
and the proletariate would show their true
beauty of character. And it would be a mistake
to ignore the real reforms which seem to have
been carried through in certain social services,
notably in the care of children, the attempt to
develop popular education and the putting
down of drink. But in the meantime terror
was re&euml;nforced by ingenious petty persecutions
and indignities, re&euml;nforced by starvation.
Those who joined the Red Army had three
times the ration of food allowed to several categories
of the civil population. No one can
wonder that suicide&mdash;that last irrefutable
evidence of unbearable oppression&mdash;became
extraordinarily common, especially among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
educated classes,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and that "frantic resistance"
broke out where it had any prospect of success.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Neighbours" id="Neighbours"></a>II. <span class="smcap">Russia's Neighbours</span></h4>

<p>But what of the war outside Russia? Why
could not the Russians be allowed to conduct
their revolution and settle their form of government
by themselves? It would be very desirable
if they could. And doubtless it is the aim
to be striven for. But the trouble is that Bolshevism
is to its adherents a revelation and a
new gospel, and they have the same zeal for
converting the rest of the world as had the
French Revolutionaries or the followers of Mohammed.
"The program of the Communist
Party is not merely a program of liberating the
proletariate of one country; it is the program of
liberating the proletariate of the world" (authorized
pamphlet by N. Bukharin, July 24,
1918). This is to be achieved by "a bloody torturing
and heroic fight." The methods are to
include every known form of intrigue, corruption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
forgery, and the like, and the plan is to be
the same in all countries. Revolutionary workmen
are to be armed, including common soldiers,
tramps, prisoners, and all the utterly dispossessed
of the earth, except, of course, those
who have Conservative, Liberal, or Labour
Party views; and then are to work their proletarian
will on the rest of the community. The
"national will" is to be disregarded: "The interests
of Socialism stand far above the interest
of the right of nations to self-determination"
(Trotzky, <i>Izvestia</i>, March 8, 1918). "All our
hopes for the definitive triumph of Socialism
are based on this conviction and on this scientific
prevision, i.e. that a revolution like the
Russian can be produced in all the nations of
Europe" (<i>ib.</i>). In the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
the Bolsheviks were compelled to sign a clause
promising not to conduct "any agitation
against the State and military institutions of
Germany." "But both the Russian Government
as a whole and its accredited representative
in Berlin never concealed the fact that
they were not observing this article, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
not intend to do so" (Joffe, <i>Izvestia</i>, January
1, 1919).</p>

<p>The belief that by some single violent change
in social, political, or economic conditions human
life as a whole can be suddenly transfigured
is one that clings to many minds, and by no
means the stupidest minds, of the present age,
in spite of much disillusioning experience. It
does seem to them at moments as if only some
one thing was wrong with the world, and as if
that one flaw must surely be definite and remediable:
some one bold step is all that is
needed&mdash;say, the abolition of the family, or of
property, or of competition, or of wages, or of
interest, or of compulsory law, or some other
of the fundamental institutions of society.</p>

<p>To our ancestors it was the abolition of
heresy. To the Turks, the abolition of all
Christians in Turkey. To such people at such
times the normal method of trying to correct
the worst abuses by persuading the majority
that they ought to be corrected, and of seeking
individually to live a better life and to help
one's neighbours, seems tedious and ineffective,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
if not hypocritical. But one thing that is clear
is that revolution means "frantic resistance,"
and the stronger the faith and energy behind
the revolution the more deep-reaching is the
resistance likely to be.</p>

<p>Russia's neighbours see what seems to them
the infinite misery and impoverishment and retardation
inflicted by Bolshevism; and they are
naturally indignant and alarmed at the secret
propaganda of Bolshevism within their own
borders. In normal times perhaps they need
not have been afraid. But since the war every
state is unstable; every state has a large discontented
class. The small republics in the Caucasus,
barely able to support themselves in
freedom, are maddened to find their constitution
threatened by Russian bribes, their malcontents
and bad characters armed with Russian
rifles and machine guns, and their public
men assassinated. Georgia and Armenia are
probably doomed. Hungary and Finland have
gone Bolshevik and returned, each process
being accompanied by hideous persecutions
and murders, the reprisals being naturally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
worst. Germany, in spite of all treaties, has
been exposed to constant propaganda and has
had one or two bad outbreaks of violence. Poland
has been and still is&mdash;whether through her
own bad policy or otherwise&mdash;on the brink of
compulsory Bolshevism. Human nature being
what it is, and human politics a little worse
than private human nature, it is inevitable that
Russia's neighbours should be constantly afraid
of her and intensely anxious to see her again
under some more normal government; some
government which, whatever its political bias,
would leave its neighbours to govern themselves
and accept the ordinary conventions of civilized
society.</p>

<p>Nay, one can even understand anti-Russian
policies that seem at first sight intolerably aggressive.
The Poles, among other demands, are
anxious for the independence of White Russia,
the region north of the Pripet, of which Minsk
is the chief town. They wish it either annexed
to Poland or else made independent, but at
any rate cut off from Russia. The claim seems
monstrous. But it has its excuse. The White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Russian peasantry are said to be peculiarly ignorant
and devoid of national feeling; the land-owners
and well-to-do classes are mostly Poles.
Is it surprising that the Poles of Poland hate
the idea of handing their countrymen over to a
Russia which will, as a matter of course, set the
peasants to burn their houses, destroy their
cattle, and hunt them themselves down like
vermin? And when that is done, they reflect,
Bolshevism will only be nearer to Warsaw.</p>

<p>Like the early Moslems, the true Bolsheviks
care more for their faith than for territory. In
dealing with Lithuania, which is at present a
comparatively quiet little peasant republic, the
Russians offered her a large slice of territory
beyond what she was entitled to or wanted.
Why? Because it was a thoroughly Bolshevized
area, and might be expected to spread
the faith&mdash;or the poison&mdash;into all Lithuania.
A nation, or a government, in that state of
mind cannot be surprised if its neighbours regard
it with anxiety.</p>

<p><br /></p><hr style="width: 33%;" /><p><br /></p>

<p>It is a curious fact that revolutionists so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
regard themselves as pacifists. Many were
even conscientious objectors during the war,
and there is no reason to doubt that they were
sincere. But they do seem to be confused
thinkers. To hate your neighbours, whom you
know, and love your neighbours' enemies,
whom you do not know, is a consistent and not
uncommon frame of mind; though the element
of love in it seems less important and prominent
than the hate. But to expect European
peace and good-will by means of a revolution
in all countries argues a lack of understanding
not far removed from madness. Every revolutionary
outburst since the war has been marked
by ferocious cruelties and followed by still more
ferocious reprisals. Revolution leads not to
peace, but to reciprocal reigns of terror, first
Red and then White, till the exhaustion of suffering
produces some sort of equilibrium.</p>

<p>The war, among its many evil lessons, has
inculcated the gospel of impatience and of
force. "When you want a thing, take it from
some one, and if he resists, knock him down."
It is the doctrine which destroys human societies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
as it destroys the peace in men's own hearts.
If we want peace, we must simply unlearn that
creed and go back to the old Liberal doctrine
that is at the root of sound politics everywhere:
"If you think something is right, try to persuade
your fellow citizens of it; try your hardest,
but remember that you may be wrong, and
until you succeed, have patience."</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h4>

<h3>PRE-WAR AND POST-WAR CAUSES<br />
OF STRIFE</h3>


<p>The war has left behind it a great number of
small wars or guerrillas. Most of them have
their explanation in some ordinary excess of
nationalism or revenge or greed. The Serbs,
intoxicated with their new greatness, are still
causing war in Albania and Montenegro. The
Rumanians recently invaded Hungary, in spite
of all the thunders of the Peace Conference, because
they had been robbed by Austria-Hungary
and wanted revenge and reparation. The
Hungarians have alarmed all their neighbours
and forced them into a defensive alliance, which
now calls itself the "Little Entente." The Lithuanians
and Poles have fought, but been reconciled
by the mediation of the League of Nations.
The Armenians have been massacred
again, under the eyes of the French army of
occupation in Cilicia, where they had gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
under a repeated guarantee of safety given by
France and England. The Turkish Nationalists
are holding out very unsuccessfully in the
centre of Anatolia against a Greek army carrying
out the directions of the Supreme Council.
The Turkish peasants are increasingly reluctant
to take arms again. The Koreans have helplessly
declared their right to independence from
Japan, and are apparently being reduced by a
terrible persecution.</p>

<p>These are the mere belated effervescence of
the passions of the Great War. The hate and
pride which are the basis of nationalism and
which were so violently stimulated by the
events of the war cannot be expected to die out
at once. It was calculated a short time ago that
there were twenty-seven "wars" of one sort or
another in progress. But they will presumably
simmer down as social conditions become more
normal.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that two of the
greatest causes of war, according to the judgment
of normal times, are now not actively
operating. Before 1914, if one was asked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
name the main causes of war, the answer would
have been, first, competitive armaments, and,
second, protective tariffs and the competition
for markets. These causes will remain fully as
dangerous for the future, but it so happens
that none of the existing wars is directly due
to either.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Armaments" id="Armaments"></a>I. <span class="smcap">Armaments</span></h4>

<p>In one sense, indeed, armaments are actually
operating now as a cause of war. There are far
too many firearms lying about. America, England,
and France have made very lavish gifts or
sales of lethal weapons to various bodies with
whom they sympathized. And the arms have
by no means always stayed in the place for
which they were intended. Guns which we sent
to Denikin were sold by corrupt officials to the
Bolsheviks, and passed on by them to the Afghans
to use against us on the Indian frontier.
Such things cause some deaths and some
laughter, but are not permanent evils.</p>

<p>No European nation, except those actually
compelled, has made much progress towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
disarmament. It is said that Great Britain has
actually made the greatest reduction, but both
in numbers of men and in expenditure our
standard is fantastically higher than what was
forced upon us by German competition in 1914.
It is impossible to reduce our forces in a really
drastic way as long as our commitments are so
large and&mdash;perhaps we must add&mdash;our policy
so inconsistent and provocative. Peace with
Russia, a settlement with Mesopotamia and
Egypt on the lines laid down by the Covenant
and the Milner Report, the evacuation of Ireland,
the execution of the Montagu-Chelmsford
reforms in India, and the extension of similar
reforms to Burmah and the much-suffering
Ceylon, will permit us really to envisage for the
first time a satisfactory measure of disarmament.
The air force is already greatly reduced.
The vast size of the navy appears to
be utterly unjustified, at any rate by conditions
in Europe. The French army is far beyond the
economic powers of France to support. The
same seems to be true of Italy, and is certainly
true of Serbia, which is still calling conscripts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to the colours. Greece is vastly overarmed; but
Greek policy, though erring on the ambitious
side, has probably been more sagaciously
guided under M. Venizelos than any in Europe.
The fall of that great man, due mainly to the
prolonged economic distresses of Greece, will
probably cause a resurgence of Mustapha
Kemal and the Turkish nationalists. Meantime
the Russian conscript army, though apparently
ill-armed and ill-supplied, is overwhelming
in numbers and is led by officers of
the old r&eacute;gime, experienced and not absolutely
incompetent. The Russian army is far the
greatest and, in a political sense, the most
dangerous, in the world.</p>

<p>But it is not the actual armaments, ruinous
as they are, that are the essential poison to civilized
society. It is the competition in armaments.
That has now been abolished throughout
Europe. Slowly, unequally, reluctantly,
the armaments which, in Lord Grey's words,
went uphill under the lead of Germany, are
now, under the same lead, groping their way
downhill. There is only one great nation which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
if words are to be believed, thinks seriously of
starting a competition in armaments. It has
been announced, more than once, by the American
Government that, like Germany in the
years before 1914, they have arranged a naval
programme which will effectually put an end
to the British command of the seas and give
the United States "world primacy" (see speech
of Mr. Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, in the
<i>Times</i> of September 1, 1920). Since the British
Empire is a scattered series of communities
dependent for their communications upon the
sea, and in particular since the population of
Great Britain is absolutely dependent for its
food on the free use of sea transport, it has been
generally acknowledged in Europe that the sea-power
of Great Britain was necessary to its
existence. British sea-power has never been
challenged except by definite enemies in pursuit
of a definite war policy. If the United
States were seriously to embark on the same
policy as the late German Government, it seems
as if all other causes of war must sink into insignificance
beside this gigantic and deliberate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
one. But, in spite of some bewildering symptoms,
it can hardly be believed that this conclusion
is possible, at any rate until America
has definitely and finally refused to be a member
of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Relations between Great Britain and America
have of late been dangerously strained,
partly owing to causes outside our Government's
control, but in part owing to the scandal
caused in America by certain developments of
the Peace Treaty, and by the excesses of the
Government forces in Ireland. A wise policy
may help to heal this growing breach, and if
America accepts in some form or other membership
of the League of Nations, it ought to
be possible in friendly discussion to arrive at
some understanding on the question of naval
armaments.</p>

<p>The problem of armaments is put in the
very forefront of the Covenant of the League,
immediately after the constitution of the
League itself. By Article VIII&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The members of the League recognize that the
maintenance of peace requires the reduction of<span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
national armaments to the lowest point consistent
with (<i>a</i>) national safety and (<i>b</i>) the enforcement by
common action of national obligations.</p>

<p>The Council, taking account of the geographical
situation and circumstances of each State, shall formulate
plans for such reduction for the consideration
and action of the several Governments.</p>

<p>Such plans shall be subject to reconsideration and
revision at least every ten years.</p>

<p>After these plans shall have been adopted by the
several Governments the limits of armament therein
fixed shall not be exceeded without the concurrence
of the Council.</p></div>

<p>The article goes on to recognize that private
munition factories are objectionable, and must
somehow be dealt with, and to lay down that
all members must interchange "full and frank
information" about their armaments and
programmes. And the next article constitutes
a permanent Commission to advise the Council
on the execution of the provisions of Article
VIII and other similar matters.</p>

<p>The cautious language of the Covenant on
this subject is due to the inherent difficulty of
the subject itself. It would be absurd to lay
down that every member of the League must
disband its forces forthwith; the League could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
hardly undertake to go to war in order to compel
some strong Power to disarm. And it is
obvious that different nations need different
degrees of armament. The chief difficulty is
that disarmament ought in justice and prudence
to be simultaneous all round. It is only
by the compulsion of a lost war that Germany
has been compelled to disarm while her enemies
stand round her with large armies, and
even in Germany the process is evidently very
difficult to enforce. Too many rifles and machine
guns have got loose in private hands. No
League could compel Poland or Rumania to
disarm while the Red Army of Russia stood
waiting across the frontier; or compel Great
Britain to disarm while the northwest frontier
of India is constantly attacked, while the Bolsheviks
are in Persia and British officials are
besieged in Mesopotamia. This difficulty will
remain even when the world begins to settle
down and the countries of Europe are no longer
governed by their War Offices. On the other
hand, economic pressure, as well as Liberal
feeling, will make for the reduction of armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and navies. It may be difficult to get volunteers
for military service, and it will certainly
be dangerous to impress conscripts. There will
be a stronger and more genuine popular demand
for disarmament than for most of the
desirable provisions of the League Covenant,
and Governments dependent on the popular
will may find their hands forced. But in the
main disarmament must depend on the restoration
of confidence; though probably it is true
in most cases that if the disarmament comes
first the confidence will follow.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Markets" id="Markets"></a>II. <span class="smcap">Markets and Food</span></h4>

<p>The second of these great causes of war, protection
and the competition for markets, has
somewhat changed its aspect since the comparative
exhaustion of the world supplies of
food and raw material. Before the war, nations
chiefly wanted to sell. Markets were the
great object of ambition, and tariff walls the
great means of offence. Great Britain, of
course, kept her doors everywhere open to the
trade of the world. It is one of the decisive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
marks to her credit in the apportionment of
the comparative guilt of the nations in preparing
that international atmosphere which made
the war of 1914 possible. But if she had chosen
at any moment to close her doors, she could
have injured grievously every other great nation
throughout the globe; and the British
Tariff Reform Campaign was one of the excuses
used by the German Government to
frighten their people into a war spirit. When
Austria wished to ruin Serbia she simply put a
prohibitive duty on the import of pigs.</p>

<p>Now, since the war, what most nations want
is not in the first place markets; it is food and
raw materials. They have not, of course, abolished
their tariffs, but their first anxiety is to
be able to buy food. Austria does not want to
keep out Serbian pigs. She begs for them, and
Serbia will not let her have them. The most
consistently and narrowly protectionist nations,
like France or Australia, no longer concentrate
on forbidding their neighbours to sell
to them. On the contrary, they refuse to sell
food and raw material to their neighbours. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
policy of keeping the food and raw materials of
the British Empire for British consumption is
already widely advocated and has powerful
champions in the Government. As long as it is
confined to palm kernels, this policy, though
bad from almost every point of view, is not
fatal. But if ever it were to be carried consistently
through, it would mean war. The
British Empire holds such a vast extent of the
earth's surface that it has inevitably given
hostages to fortune. So huge an empire can
only be tolerated if it behaves tolerably. If we
keep to ourselves and use for our own profit
all the overwhelmingly large stores of food and
raw material which by our vast annexations
of territory we now control, thereby reducing
other nations first to a stagnation of trade and
then to starvation, the natural and inevitable
answer to such a proceeding would seem to be
a world crusade for our destruction.</p>

<p>This is the chief point, apparently, in which
the influence of what is called "capitalism"
seems to be a direct cause of war. Great capitalists,
or those impersonal organizations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
capital which seem likely now to supersede the
individual capitalist, are normally strong influences
for peace. They need peace for the
success of their undertakings and are in danger
of ruin if war breaks out. But they do at times
stand to gain enormous sums by concessions
and monopolies and by control over materials
which are the subject of an intense demand
from great masses of people. And no doubt
one way in which they will seek to get these
monopolies and controls is by putting pressure
on Governments for so-called patriotic reasons
to exclude foreign competition. This is a very
real danger.</p>

<p>The Covenant of the League of Nations has
not dared to insist on free trade. Obviously it
could not, since the majority of the member
nations are against free trade. But it does lay
down certain rules to check aggressive protection.</p>

<p>All the territories transferred by the war from
the possession of Germany and Turkey to their
conquerors are subjected to the principle of
mandate. They are not held as possessions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
They are held "as a sacred trust for civilization"
with the express purpose of securing the
"well-being and development" of the native
populations. In particular, the mandatories
agree to guarantee "equal opportunities for the
trade and commerce of other members of the
League." As the membership of the League is
increased, this will practically ensure the "open
door" to all nations in the mandated areas. It
seems also clearly to forbid the establishment
of national monopolies. If a mandatory finds
copper-mines or oil-wells in its territory, it is
bound to develop them as "a trust for civilization."
Any profit it receives must be in the
nature of wages for work done. A mandatory
may not exclude or hamper the trade of another
member of the League by tariffs,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> much less
keep the oil for the exclusive use of itself and
its friends, as is at present proposed by England
and France in Mesopotamia. The condemnation
of this proposal by the Assembly of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
League in November, 1920, backed by a vigorous
protest from the United States, has, it may
be hoped, made such a violation of the Covenant
impossible.</p>

<p>In territories not mandated as a result of the
war, but otherwise similar to the mandated
areas, such as the pre-war colonies of the various
Powers, these rules, of course, do not hold.
Yet it may be hoped that at least they will be
recognized as good rules, to which approximation
should be made as circumstances permit.</p>

<p>In all their dealings, moreover, members of
the League agree (Article XXIII) to "secure
and maintain freedom of communications and
of transit, and equitable treatment for the commerce
of all members of the League." The language
of this article is a little vague. One can
trace in it the influence of a struggle. But at
least it forbids tariff wars, and it gives the
League a handle for interference in case of any
very great iniquity. It does not forbid national
monopolies; but a monopoly in foodstuffs
which came near to inflicting famine on other
members of the League would, under it, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
least give cause for remark. And no clause,
however strong, could in practice be sure of
attaining more. The League has to be built
out of nations as they already exist, and the
rules of the League out of their public opinion.
The real danger here, as in so many other cases,
lies not in the caution and moderation of the
language used in the Covenant, but first in the
questionable sincerity of the nations in carrying
out the pledges signed by their representatives,
and secondly in the possibility that,
through ill-will, or fear, or self-interest, or mob-passion,
or some other disastrous influence,
the ex-enemy Powers be not quickly included in
the League. Not until all Central Europe is in
the League can the world begin to breathe
freely.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h4>

<h3>THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS</h3>


<p>We have considered many parts of the world
and many aspects of the present world settlement
to see what seeds of future war may now
be germinating and what means we have of
making them harmless. And in every case we
are brought back to the one great creative idea
which this war has produced, the League of Nations.
The earlier notions of the League, as
issued, for example, about the year 1909 by
certain American bodies, centred upon the development
of compulsory mediation or arbitration
and the setting up of a recognized permanent
Court of International Law. The flaw in
this conception, operating alone, is a certain
rigidity and barrenness. It left states to work
separately until they quarrelled or saw a quarrel
approaching, and only then, when the atmosphere
was already bad, it expected them to
meet and accept arbitration. A great addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to this was Sir Edward Grey's conception, already
put in practice during the Balkan Wars,
of an extended <i>entente cordiale</i> embracing all
Europe and America. In his time France and
England, England and America, England and
Italy, had formed a habit of cordiality and
frank dealing. When any trouble arose, the
ambassadors had the habit of meeting freely
and discussing the trouble with perfect frankness,
almost as members of the same Ministry
might do. This tendency was helped by the
enormous increase in international conferences,
commissions, and bureaux. And during the
Balkan crisis of 1912-13 it was in process of
being extended to include Germany. Thus
there was the habit of frequent co&ouml;peration
and mutual confidence. Unfortunately, this
friendly spirit depended on all parties being
generally content with the present condition of
affairs; Germany was not content, and so the
<i>entente</i> idea was balked. Under the League the
nations are already forming a habit of consultation
and co&ouml;peration on non-controversial
matters which should be of immense help in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
dealing with differences when they arise. Another
great formative idea was contributed by
General Smuts, the principle of the mandate.
He foresaw that there would be at the end of
the war an immense appropriation of tropical
colonies; he knew that the rivalry of the Great
Powers for the possession of such colonies was
one of the chief sources of international strife;
and he saw that the right outlet was to put an
end to the treatment of colonies as "possessions"
or mere sources of wealth to the colonizing
Power. The populations that are not able
to stand alone should be taken in trust by the
whole League of Nations, which should appoint
a particular Power in each particular case
to carry out the trust. Again, the great stirring
of discontent among the labouring classes in
almost all parts of the world led to the formation
of a special International Commission on
Labour, which has so far met with great success.
It will in general have the effect of raising
the conditions of the most backward peoples
to something like the level of the best.</p>

<p>And lastly, when all these things were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
train, the policy for which both Great Britain
and the late Czar of Russia had striven so long
and vainly would at last become feasible, and
the nations might consent to disarm.</p>

<p>Thus the Covenant of the League, an unpretentious
but well-considered document, the
result of repeated criticism and study by many
of the best minds in Europe and America, attempts
to meet and check all the visible and
predictable causes of war.</p>

<p>There should be no wars of ambition. They
are to be met by absolute coercion. The League
can make it certain that deliberate war undertaken
for national aggrandizement will end,
not in profit, but in ruinous loss.</p>

<p>There should be no wars caused by the irresistible
desire to escape from foreign oppression
or intolerable conditions. They are made unnecessary
by provisions enabling any oppressed
nation to lay its case before the Assembly or
Council and obtain such redress as the most
disinterested tribunal can give.</p>

<p>A war which is caused by the emergence of
some clash of interest or unforeseen dispute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
between two states cannot, in the nature of things,
be made absolutely impossible. The League
opposes to that danger, not a blank wall, but,
as it were, a series of springs calculated to exhaust
its force; a court for points of law, mediation
for points of policy, compulsory delay and
reconsideration for all disputes whatsoever. It
will be a strange dispute which, given honest
intentions on both sides, lasts through all the
checks provided by Articles XII to XVII and
plunges nations into war at the end of them.</p>

<p>Wars caused by rivalry for the possession of
colonies and rebellions caused in colonies by
unjust exploitation are, as far as regards mandated
areas, provided against by Article XXII;
for the other colonial territories, which do not
come under a mandate, at least the way of
safety is shown.</p>

<p>Wars caused, or made more likely, by the
mutual prejudices of nations, by their habit of
working always apart and in secrecy, are met by
the immense field of international co&ouml;peration
which the League proposes, and its absolute insistence
upon frank interchange of information.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Wars caused by exclusive tariffs or national
monopolies of material are in part provided
against by Articles XXII and XXIII and in
part by XI.</p>

<p>Wars which might be caused by domestic
revolutions, as in Russia, are made less likely
by the Labour Commission, which assures a
remedy for any labour conditions in a particular
country which are so bad as to incur the active
condemnation of the world.</p>

<p>But it is impossible by mere enumeration to
be sure of meeting all the causes from which
some new war may start. The League, in the
last resort, falls back on the mutual trust and
good-will of its members, and particularly of
its members' representatives, secured partly by
the common interest in peace and partly by the
habit of co&ouml;peration for ordinary affairs. The
<i>esprit de corps</i> of the League's permanent Secretariat,
with a professional interest in the preservation
of peace and good-will, is a new and
important factor in the world's life. Any member
of the League has the right to bring to the
attention of the Assembly or Council "any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
circumstance whatever affecting international relations
which threatens to disturb international
peace or the good understanding between nations
upon which peace depends."</p>

<p>In America the Covenant of the League is
apt to be represented as a terribly drastic and
tyrannical document. Cartoons show John
Bull, or some equally repulsive abstraction,
dressed in khaki, dragging away American
youths to fight enemies of the League in remote
parts of Asia or Africa. But on this side of the
Atlantic it is generally criticized for not being
drastic enough. It does not make war formally
impossible. It does not bind all its members to
make war on any Covenant-breaker. It does
not even bind any member of the League to accept
the decision of the majority. It leaves its
members almost as free as if they were outside.
They are pledged to accept, if they ask for it, a
decision of the International Court; they are
pledged to the principle of mandate; they are
pledged to boycott any deliberate war-maker.
But that is practically all. The League's true
weapon is not force, but publicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>The truth is, and it is a truth of fundamental
importance in political matters, that no structure
can be more rigid than the material of
which it is made. Engagements between human
beings must needs be as elastic as human
nature itself. Had the Covenant laid down
that every member of the League was to make
war or peace, or change its foreign policy, in
obedience to the majority of the Council or Assembly
and in disregard of the wishes of its
own parliament, the result would have been
either that no nations would join such a League
or that, if they did, the League would break at
the first strain.</p>

<p>The principles laid down in the Covenant
are, in the judgment of the present writer,
principles long recognized and absolutely right.
If generally acted on, they will prevent war. If
generally neglected and broken, they will allow
wars to ensue. This fact seems to be pretty
generally recognized among the more reputable
statesmen of Europe. But it remains unfortunately
true that they are principles implying a
considerably higher standard of international<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
morality than has hitherto been consistently
observed by any nations, even the best. If absolute
fidelity to the Covenant by all its signatories
were necessary for the peace of the world,
the world would have a very poor prospect before
it. What we must aim at is as much fidelity
as possible. There are great difficulties.
America is absent. Germany and Russia are
absent. France cannot yet quite escape from
her war psychology. But if Great Britain is
faithful, it will be hard for other nations to be
obviously and grossly false. The European neutrals,
like Switzerland, Holland, and Norway,
will be clear voices for justice and fair dealing.
The beaten nations, when once admitted, will
probably be on the same side, since when
wrong-doing begins it is the weak who are first
to suffer. And, after all, all human beings have
a strong dislike of injustice, when they do not
directly gain by it. The great majority of the
fifty-one members of the League will be disinterested
on most questions of dispute, and will
therefore form a good tribunal of opinion.</p>

<p>But the mere clash of contrary selfishnesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
produces no sound equilibrium. The League
will not succeed unless in some of the great nations,
above all in Great Britain, there are at
the head of affairs statesmen who believe firmly
in the principles of the League and are capable
both of effort and of self-sacrifice for the sake
of them, and behind the statesmen a strong and
intelligent determination in the mass of the
people to see that the League is made genuinely
the leading force in international politics.</p>

<p>The present disorder of the world is one of
those in which the remedy is not obscure, but
perfectly ascertained. The only difficulty lies
in applying it. The nations of the world must
co&ouml;perate; and for that they must trust one
another; and for that the only way is for each
Government separately to be worthy of trust.</p>

<p>It will be long, no doubt, before this end is
consummated or even approached. The foregoing
pages have shown how far from perfect is
the practice of even the most stable and advanced
nations. And the tendencies set up by
the war, with its infinite reactions and ramifications,
are almost all such as to make vastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
more difficult in each case the necessary effort
towards good faith and good-will. Yet, if the
difficulties are greater, the necessity is greater
also; and after all the war has brought its inspirations
as well as its corruptions. The craving
for this Peace which has not come is, I believe,
still the unspoken and often unconscious
motive of millions who seem, at first glance, to
be only brawling for revenges or revolutions; it
lies, like a mysterious torment, at the heart of
this storm-tossed and embittered world, crying
for it knows not what.</p>

The other points were briefly: Evacuation of Russia:
restoration of Belgium; of France; transference of Alsace-Lorraine;
territorial settlement of Italy; autonomy of peoples
of Austria-Hungary; settlement of Balkan States; of Turkey;
restoration of Poland; and lastly a League of Nations&mdash;though
President Wilson never used that somewhat inaccurate
phrase. I should like to acknowledge here my indebtedness

See Keynes, pp. 60-102. A provision was kept enabling
all such private property to be confiscated in case the German
Government should "voluntarily fail" to fulfil its engagements.
But this also was dropped by the British Government
in October, 1920.</p></div>

The Allies are apparently acting under Part VIII, clause
18, of the treaty. This gives them the right to "take such other
measures as the respective Governments may determine to be
necessary" in case of "voluntary default" by Germany in the
payment of her dues under Part VIII (Reparations). A failure
by Germany to disarm sufficiently gives the Allies no right to
increase the area of their occupation, since the present occupation
is specifically laid down in the treaty negotiations as the
means of enforcing disarmament. Nor has Germany yet actually
committed a voluntary default in the payment of her reparations,
since the first payment, &pound;100,000,000, is not to be
completed until May 1, 1921. I am informed on high authority
that the Allied case probably rests on the point that they judge
by their debtor's manner and by statements which she has
made that she intends not to pay by May 1; according to
English law this would apparently give them some right of
taking immediate action.</p></div>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
